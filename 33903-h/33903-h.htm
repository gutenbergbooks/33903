<h1>Into the Primitive</h1>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>WAVE-TOSSED AND CASTAWAY</span></h2>

<p>The beginning was at Cape Town, when
Blake and Winthrope boarded the steamer
as fellow passengers with Lady Bayrose
and her party.</p>

<p>This was a week after Winthrope had arrived
on the tramp steamer from India, and her Ladyship
had explained to Miss Leslie that it was as
well for her not to be too hasty in accepting his
attentions. To be sure, he was an Englishman,
his dress and manners were irreproachable, and
he was in the prime of ripened youth. Yet Lady
Bayrose was too conscientious a chaperon to be
fully satisfied with her countryman&#8217;s bare assertion
that he was engaged on a diplomatic mission
requiring reticence regarding his identity. She
did not see why this should prevent him from
confiding in <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, Winthrope came aboard
ship virtually as a member of her Ladyship&#8217;s
party. He was so quick, so thoughtful of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
comfort, and paid so much more attention to her
than to Miss Leslie, that her Ladyship had decided
to tolerate him, even before Blake became
a factor in the situation.</p>

<p>From the moment he crossed the gangway the
American engineer entered upon a daily routine
of drinking and gambling, varied only by attempts
to strike up an off-hand acquaintance with
Miss Leslie. This was Winthrope&#8217;s opportunity,
and his clever frustration of what Lady Bayrose
termed &#8220;that low bounder&#8217;s impudence&#8221; served
to install him in the good graces of her Ladyship
as well as in the favor of the American heiress.</p>

<p>Such, at least, was what Winthrope intimated
to the persistent engineer with a superciliousness
of tone and manner that would have stung even
a British lackey to resentment. To Blake it was
supremely galling. He could not rejoin in kind,
and the slightest attempt at physical retort would
have meant irons and confinement. It was a British
ship. Behind Winthrope was Lady Bayrose;
behind her Ladyship, as a matter of course, was all
the despotic authority of the captain. In the circumstances,
it was not surprising that the American
drank heavier after each successive goading.</p>

<p>Meantime the ship, having touched at Port
Natal, steamed on up the East Coast, into the
Mozambique Channel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>On the day of the cyclone, Blake had withdrawn
into his stateroom with a number of
bottles, and throughout that fearful afternoon
was blissfully unconscious of the danger. Even
when the steamer went on the reef, he was only
partially roused by the shock.</p>

<p>He took a long pull from a quart flask of
whiskey, placed the flask with great care in his
hip pocket, and lurched out through the open
doorway. There he reeled headlong against the
mate, who had rushed below with three of the
crew to bring up Miss Leslie. The mate cursed
him virulently, and in the same breath ordered
two of the men to fetch him up on deck.</p>

<p>The sea was breaking over the steamer in torrents;
but between waves Blake was dragged
across to the side and flung over into the bottom
of the one remaining boat. He served as a
cushion to break the fall of Miss Leslie, who was
tossed in after him. At the same time, Winthrope,
frantic with fear, scrambled into the bows
and cut loose. One of the sailors leaped, but fell
short and went down within arm&#8217;s length of Miss
Leslie.</p>

<p>She and Winthrope saw the steamer slip from
the reef and sink back into deep water, carrying
down in the vortex the mate and the few remaining
sailors. After that all was chaos to them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
They were driven ashore before the terrific gusts
of the cyclone, blinded by the stinging spoondrift
to all else but the hell of breakers and coral reefs
in whose midst they swirled so dizzily. And
through it all Blake lay huddled on the bottom
boards, gurgling blithely of spicy zephyrs and
swaying hammocks.</p>

<p>There came the seemingly final moment when
the boat went spinning stern over prow. . . . .</p>

<p>Half sobered, Blake opened his eyes and stared
solemnly about him. He was given little time to
take his bearings. A smother of broken surf
came seething up from one of the great breakers,
to roll him over and scrape him a little farther up
the muddy shore. There the flood deposited him
for a moment, until it could gather force to sweep
back and drag him down again toward the roaring
sea that had cast him up.</p>

<p>Blake objected,&#8211;not to the danger of being
drowned, but to interference with his repose. He
had reached the obstinate stage. He grunted a
protest. . . . . Again the flood seethed up the
shore, and rolled him away from the danger.
This was too much! He set his jaw, turned over,
and staggered to his feet. Instantly one of the
terrific wind-blasts struck his broad back and
sent him spinning for yards. He brought up in
a shallow pool, beside a hummock.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>Under the lee of the knoll lay Winthrope and
Miss Leslie. Though conscious, both were draggled
and bruised and beaten to exhaustion.
They were together because they had come
ashore together. When the boat capsized, Miss
Leslie had been flung against the Englishman,
and they had held fast to each other with the
desperate clutch of drowning persons. Neither
of them ever recalled how they gained the shelter
of the hummock.</p>

<p>Blake, sitting waist-deep in the pool, blinked at
them benignly with his pale blue eyes, and produced
the quart flask, still a third full of whiskey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shay, fren&#8217;s,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;ha&#8217; one on me.
Won&#8217; cos&#8217; you shent&#8211;notta re&#8217; shent!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You fuddled lout!&#8221; shouted Winthrope.
&#8220;Come out of that pool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wassama&#8217;er pool! Pool&#8217;s allri&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Englishman squinted through the driving
scud at the intoxicated man with an anxious
frown. In all probability he felt no commiseration
for the American; but it was no light matter
to be flung up barehanded on the most unhealthful
and savage stretch of the Mozambique coast,
and Blake might be able to help them out of
their predicament. To leave him in the pool was
therefore not to be thought of. So soon as he
had drained his bottle, he would lie down, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
that would be the end of him. As any attempt
to move him forcibly was out of the question,
the situation demanded that Winthrope justify
his intimations of diplomatic training. After considering
the problem for several minutes, he met
it in a way that proved he was at least not lacking
in shrewdness and tact.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Blake,&#8221; he called, in another lull
between the shrieking gusts, &#8220;the lady is fatigued.
You&#8217;re too much of a gentleman to ask
her to come over there.&#8221;</p>

<p>It required some moments for this to penetrate
Blake&#8217;s fuddled brain. After a futile attempt to
gain his feet, he crawled out of the pool on all
fours, and, with tears in his eyes, pressed his flask
upon Miss Leslie. She shrank away from him,
shuddering, and drew herself up in a huddle of
flaccid limbs and limp garments. Winthrope,
however, not only accepted the flask, but came
near to draining it.</p>

<p>Blake squinted at the diminished contents,
hesitated, and cast a glance of maudlin gallantry
at Miss Leslie. She lay coiled, closer than before,
in a draggled heap. Her posture suggested sleep.
Blake stared at her, the flask extended waveringly
before him. Then he brought it to his lips, and
drained out the last drop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time turn in,&#8221; he mumbled, and sprawled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
full length in the brackish ooze. Immediately
he fell into a drunken stupor.</p>

<p>Winthrope, invigorated by the liquor, rose to
his knees, and peered around. It was impossible
to face the scud and spoondrift from the furious
sea; but to leeward he caught a glimpse of a
marsh flooded with salt water, its reedy vegetation
beaten flat by the storm. He himself was
beaten down by a terrific gust. Panting and
trembling, he waited for the wind to lull, in hope
that he might obtain a clearer view of his surroundings.
Before he again dared rise to his
feet, darkness swept down with tropical suddenness
and blurred out everything.</p>

<p>The effect of the whiskey soon passed, and Winthrope
huddled between his companions, drenched
and exhausted. Though he could hear Miss Leslie
moaning, he was too miserable himself to
inquire whether he could do anything for her.</p>

<p>Presently he became aware that the wind was
falling. The centre of the cyclone had passed
before the ship struck, and they were now in the
outermost circle of the vast whirlwind. With
the consciousness of this change for the better,
Winthrope&#8217;s fear-racked nerves relaxed, and he
fell into a heavy sleep.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>WORSE THAN WILDERNESS</span></h2>

<p>A wail from Miss Leslie roused the Englishman
out of a dream in which he had
been swimming for life across a sea of
boiling oil. He sat up and gazed about him,
half dazed. The cyclone had been followed by
a dead calm, and the sun, already well above the
horizon, was blazing upon them over the glassy
surfaces of the dying swells with fierce heat.</p>

<p>Winthrope felt about for his hat. It had been
blown off when, at the striking of the steamer,
he had rushed up on deck. As he remembered,
he straightened, and looked at his companions.
Blake lay snoring where he had first outstretched
himself, sleeping the sleep of the just&#8211;and of
the drunkard. The girl, however, was already
awake. She sat with her hands clasped in her lap,
while the tears rolled slowly down her cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;My&#8211;ah&#8211;dear Miss Genevieve, what is the
matter?&#8221; exclaimed Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Matter? Do you ask, when we are here on
this wretched coast, and may not get away for
weeks? Oh, I did so count on the London season
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
this year! Lady Bayrose promised that I should
be among those presented.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8211;ah&#8211;fancy, Lady Bayrose will do
no more presenting&#8211;unless it may be to the
heavenly choir, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what do you mean, Mr. Winthrope?
You told me that she and the maids had been put
in the largest boat&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Miss Genevieve, you must remember
that I am a diplomat. It was all quite sufficiently
harrowing, I assure you. They were, indeed,
put into the largest boat&#8211;Beastly muddle!&#8211;While
they waited for the mate to fetch you,
the boat was crushed alongside, and all in it
drowned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Drowned!&#8211;drowned! Oh, dear Lady Bayrose!
And she&#8217;d travelled so much&#8211;oh, oh,
it is horrible! Why did she persuade me to
visit the Cape? It was only to be with her&#8211;And
then for us to start off for India, when we
might have sailed straight to England! Oh, it
is horrible! horrible! And my maid, and all&#8211;It
cannot be possible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray, do not excite yourself, my dear Miss
Genevieve. Their troubles are all over. Er&#8211;Gawd
has taken them to Him, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the pity of it! To be drowned&#8211;so far
from home!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>&#8220;Ah, if that&#8217;s all you&#8217;re worrying about!&#8211;I
must say I&#8217;d like to know how we&#8217;ll get a snack
for breakfast. I&#8217;m hungry as a&#8211;er&#8211;groom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eating! How can you think of eating, Mr.
Winthrope&#8211;and all the others drowned? This
sun is becoming dreadfully hot. It is unbearable!
Can you not put up some kind of an awning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, I must say, I was never much of
a hand at such things, and really I can&#8217;t imagine
what one could rig up. There might have been
a bit of sail in the boat, but one can&#8217;t see a sign
of it. I fancy it was smashed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie ventured a glance at Blake. Though
still lying as he had sprawled in his drunkenness,
there was a comforting suggestion of power in
his broad shoulders and square jaw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he still&#8211;in that condition?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must have slept it off by this time, and there&#8217;s
no more in the flask,&#8221; answered Winthrope.
Reaching over with his foot, he pushed against
Blake&#8217;s back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! All right,&#8221; grunted the sleeper, and
sat up, as had Winthrope, half dazed. Then he
stared around him, and rose to his feet. &#8220;Well,
what in hell! Say, this is damn cheerful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy we are in a nasty fix. But I say, my
man, there is a woman present, and your language,
you know&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>Blake turned and fixed the Englishman with a
cold stare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, you bloomin&#8217; lud,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there&#8217;s
just one thing you&#8217;re going to understand, right
here and now. I&#8217;m not your man, and we&#8217;re
not going to have any of that kind of blatter.
Any fool can see we&#8217;re in a tight hole, and we&#8217;re
like to keep company for a while&#8211;probably
long as we last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8211;ah&#8211;may I ask, do you mean by
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake laughed harshly, and pointed from the
reef-strewn sea to the vast stretches of desolate
marsh. Far inland, across miles of brackish lagoons
and reedy mud-flats, could be seen groups
of scrubby, half-leafless trees; ten or twelve
miles to the southward a rocky headland jutted
out into the water; otherwise there was nothing
in sight but sea and swamp. If it could not
properly be termed a sea-view, it was at least a
very wet landscape.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine prospect,&#8221; remarked Blake, dryly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
be in luck if the fever don&#8217;t get the last of us inside
a month; and as for you two, you&#8217;d have as
much show of lasting a month as a toad with a
rattlesnake, if it wasn&#8217;t for Tom Blake,&#8211;that&#8217;s
my name&#8211;Tom Blake,&#8211;and as long as this
shindy lasts, you&#8217;re welcome to call me Tom or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
Blake, whichever suits. But understand, we&#8217;re
not going to have any more of your bloody,
bloomin&#8217; English condescension. Aboard ship
you had the drop on me, and could pile on dog
till the cows came home. Here I&#8217;m Blake, and
you&#8217;re Winthrope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me, Mr. Blake, I quite appreciate the&#8211;ah&#8211;situation. And now, I fancy that, instead
of wasting time&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about time you introduced me to the
lady,&#8221; interrupted Blake, and he stared at them
half defiantly, yet with a twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>Miss Leslie flushed. Winthrope swore softly,
and bit his lip. Aboard ship, backed by Lady
Bayrose and the captain, he had goaded the
American at pleasure. Now, however, the situation
was reversed. Both title and authority had
been swept away by the storm, and he was left to
shift for himself against the man who had every
reason to hate him for his overbearing insolence.
Worse still, both he and Miss Leslie were now
dependent upon the American, in all probability
for life itself. It was a bitter pill and hard to
swallow.</p>

<p>Blake was not slow to observe the Englishman&#8217;s
hesitancy. He grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every dog has his day, and I guess this is
mine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Take your time, if it comes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
hard. I can imagine it&#8217;s a pretty stiff dose for
your ludship. But why in&#8211;why in frozen
hades an American lady should object to an
introduction to a countryman who&#8217;s going to do
his level best to save her pretty little self from
the hyenas&#8211;well, it beats me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope flushed redder than the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Leslie, Mr. Blake,&#8221; he murmured, hoping
to put an end to the situation.</p>

<p>But yet Blake persisted. He bowed, openly
exultant.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Miss,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I know the correct
thing quite as much as your swells. I knew all
along you were Jenny Leslie. I ran a survey
for your dear papa when he was manipulating
the Q. T. Railroad, and he did me out of my
pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but Mr. Blake, I am sure it must be a
mistake; I am sure that if it is explained to
papa&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; we&#8217;ll cable papa to-night. Meantime,
we&#8217;ve something else to do. Suppose you two
get a hustle on yourselves, and scrape up something
to eat. I&#8217;m going out to see what&#8217;s left of
that blamed old tub.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely you&#8217;ll not venture to swim out so
far!&#8221; protested Winthrope. &#8220;I saw the steamer
sink as we cast off.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>&#8220;Looks like a mast sticking up out there. Maybe
some of the rigging is loose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the sharks! These waters swarm with
the vile creatures. You must not risk your life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause why? If I do, the babes in the
woods will be left without even the robins to
cover them, poor things! But cheer up!&#8211;maybe
the mud-hens will do it with lovely water-lilies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Mr. Blake, do not be so cruel!&#8221;
sobbed Miss Leslie, her tears starting afresh.
&#8220;The sun makes my head ache dreadfully, and
I have no hat or shade, and I&#8217;m becoming so
thirsty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you think you&#8217;ve only to wait, and half
a dozen stewards will come running with parasols
and ice water. Neither you nor Winthrope seem
to &#8217;ve got your eyes open. Just suppose you get
busy and do something. Winthrope, chase yourself
over the mud, and get together a mess of fish
that are not too dead. Must be dozens, after the
blow. As for you, Miss Jenny, I guess you can
pick up some reeds, and rig a headgear out of
this handkerchief&#8211; Wait a moment. Put on
my coat, if you don&#8217;t want to be broiled alive
through the holes of that peek-a-boo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I say, Blake&#8211;&#8221; began Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say&#8211;do!&#8221; rejoined Blake; and he
started down the muddy shore.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>Though the tide was at flood, there was now
no cyclone to drive the sea above the beach, and
Blake walked a quarter of a mile before he
reached the water&#8217;s edge. There was little surf,
and he paused only a few moments to peer out
across the low swells before he commenced to
strip.</p>

<p>Winthrope and Miss Leslie had been watching
his movements; now the girl rose in a little flurry
of haste, and set to gathering reeds. Winthrope
would have spoken, but, seeing her embarrassment,
smiled to himself, and began strolling
about in search of fish.</p>

<p>It was no difficult search. The marshy ground
was strewn with dead sea-creatures, many of
which were already shrivelling and drying in the
sun. Some of the fish had a familiar look, and
Winthrope turned them over with the tip of his
shoe. He even went so far as to stoop to pick up
a large mullet; but shrank back, repulsed by its
stiffness and the unnatural shape into which the
sun was warping it.</p>

<p>He found himself near the beach, and stood for
half an hour or more watching the black dot far
out in the water,&#8211;all that was to be seen of
Blake. The American, after wading off-shore
another quarter of a mile, had reached swimming
depth, and was heading out among the reefs with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
steady, vigorous strokes. Half a mile or so
beyond him Winthrope could now make out the
goal for which he was aiming,&#8211;the one remaining
topmast of the steamer.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, these waters are full of sharks!&#8221;
murmured Winthrope, staring at the steadily receding
dot until it disappeared behind the wall of
surf which spumed up over one of the outer
reefs.</p>

<p>A call from Miss Leslie interrupted his watch,
and he hastened to rejoin her. After several
failures, she had contrived to knot Blake&#8217;s handkerchief
to three or four reeds in the form of a
little sunshade. Her shoulders were protected
by Blake&#8217;s coat. It made a heavy wrap, but it
shut out the blistering sun-rays, which, as Blake
had foreseen, had quickly begun to burn the
girl&#8217;s delicate skin through her open-work bodice.</p>

<p>Thus protected, she was fairly safe from the
sun. But the sun was by no means the worst
feature of the situation. While Winthrope was
yet several yards distant, the girl began to complain
to him. &#8220;I&#8217;m so thirsty, Mr. Winthrope!
Where is there any water? Please get me a
drink at once, Mr. Winthrope!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear Miss Leslie, there is no water.
These pools are all sea-water. I must say, I&#8217;m
deuced dry myself. I can&#8217;t see why that cad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
should go off and leave us like this, when we
need him most.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, it is a shame&#8211;Oh, I&#8217;m so thirsty!
Do you think it would help if we ate something?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it all the worse. Besides, how could
we cook anything? All these reeds are green, or
at least water-soaked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mr, Blake said to gather some fish. Had
you not best&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can pick up all he wants. I shall not
touch the beastly things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I suppose there is nothing to do but
wait for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if the sharks do not get him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie uttered a little moan, and Winthrope,
seeing that she was on the verge of tears,
hastened to reassure her. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about
him, Miss Genevieve! He&#8217;ll soon return, with
nothing worse than a blistered back. Fellows of
that sort are born to hang, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if he should be&#8211;if anything should
happen to him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope shrugged his shoulders, and drew
out his silver cigarette case. It was more than
half full, and he was highly gratified to find that
neither the cigarettes nor the vesta matches in
the cover had been reached by the wet.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, here&#8217;s luck!&#8221; he exclaimed, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
bowed to Miss Leslie. &#8220;Pardon me, but if you
have no objections&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl nodded as a matter of form, and Winthrope
hastened to light the cigarette already in
his fingers. The smoke by no means tended to
lessen the dryness of his mouth; yet it put him
in a reflective mood, and in thinking over what
he had read of shipwrecked parties, he remembered
that a pebble held in the mouth is supposed
to ease one&#8217;s thirst.</p>

<p>To be sure, there was not a sign of a pebble
within miles of where they sat; but after some
reflection, it occurred to him that one of his steel
keys might do as well. At first Miss Leslie was
reluctant to try the experiment, and only the
increasing dryness of her mouth forced her to
seek the promised relief. Though it failed to
quench her thirst, she was agreeably surprised
to find that the little flat bar of metal eased her
craving to a marked degree.</p>

<p>Winthrope now thought to rig a shade as Miss
Leslie had done, out of reeds and his handkerchief,
for the sun was scorching his unprotected
head. Thus sheltered, the two crouched as comfortably
as they could upon the half-dried crest
of the hummock, and waited impatiently for the
return of Blake.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE WORTH OF FIRE</span></h2>

<p>Though the sea within the reefs was fast
smoothing to a glassy plain in the dead
calm, they did not see Blake on his return
until he struck shallow water and stood up
to wade ashore. The tide had begun to ebb
before he started landward, and though he was a
powerful swimmer, the long pull against the current
had so tired him that when he took to wading
he moved at a tortoise-like gait.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bloomin&#8217; loafer!&#8221; commented Winthrope.
He glanced quickly about, and at sight of Miss
Leslie&#8217;s arching brows, hastened to add: &#8220;Beg
pardon! He&#8211;ah&#8211;reminds me so much of a
navvy, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie made no reply.</p>

<p>At last Blake was out of the water and toiling
up the muddy beach to the spot where he had
left his clothes. While dressing he seemed to
recover from his exertions in the water, for the
moment he had finished, he sprang to his feet and
came forward at a brisk pace.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>As he approached, Winthrope waved his fifth
cigarette at him with languid enthusiasm, and
called out as heartily as his dry lips would
permit: &#8220;I say, Blake, deuced glad the sharks
didn&#8217;t get you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sharks?&#8211;bah! All you have to do is to
splash a little, and they haul off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the steamer, Mr. Blake?&#8221; asked
Miss Leslie, turning to face him.</p>

<p>&#8220;All under but the maintopmast&#8211;curse it!&#8211;wire
rigging at that! Couldn&#8217;t even get a
bolt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A bolt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bolt; and here we are as good as naked
on this infernal&#8211; Hey, you! what you doing
with that match? Light your cigarette&#8211;light
it!&#8211; Damnation!&#8221;</p>

<p>Heedless of Blake&#8217;s warning cry, Winthrope
had struck his last vesta, and now, angry and
bewildered, he stood staring while the little taper
burned itself out. With an oath, Blake sprang to
catch it as it dropped from between Winthrope&#8217;s
fingers. But he was too far away. It fell among
the damp rushes, spluttered, and flared out.</p>

<p>For a moment Blake knelt, staring at the
rushes as though stupefied; then he sprang up
before Winthrope, his bronzed face purple with
anger.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your matchbox? Got any more?&#8221;
he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Last one, I fancy&#8211;yes; last one, and there
are still two cigarettes. But look here, Blake, I
can&#8217;t tolerate your talking so deucedly&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You idiot! you&#8211;you&#8211; Hell! and every
one for cigarettes!&#8221;</p>

<p>From a growl Blake&#8217;s voice burst into a roar
of fury, and he sprang upon Winthrope like a
wild beast. His hands closed upon the Englishman&#8217;s
throat, and he began to shake him about,
paying no heed to the blows his victim showered
upon his face and body, blows which soon began
to lessen in force.</p>

<p>Terror-stricken, Miss Leslie put her hands over
her eyes, and began to scream&#8211;the piercing
shriek that will unnerve the strongest man.
Blake paused as though transfixed, and as the
half-suffocated Englishman struggled in his grasp,
he flung him on the ground, and turned to the
screaming girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop that squawking!&#8221; he said. The girl
cowed down. &#8220;So; that&#8217;s better. Next time
keep your mouth shut.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8211;you brute!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! You&#8217;ve got a little spunk, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You coward&#8211;to attack a man not half your
strength!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>&#8220;Steady, steady, young lady! I&#8217;m warm
enough yet; I&#8217;ve still half a mind to wring his
fool neck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should you be so angry! What
has he done, that you&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;why? Lord! what hasn&#8217;t he done!
This coast fairly swarms with beasts. We&#8217;ve
not the smell of a gun; and now this idiot&#8211;this
dough-head&#8211;has gone and thrown away
our only chance&#8211;fire&#8211;and on his measly
cigarettes!&#8221; Blake choked with returning
rage.</p>

<p>Winthrope, still panting for breath, began to
creep away, at the same time unclasping a small
penknife. He was white with fear; but his gray
eyes&#8211;which on shipboard Blake had never seen
other than offensively supercilious&#8211;now glinted
in a manner that served to alter the American&#8217;s
mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come here and show
me that knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show it you where it will do the most
good,&#8221; muttered Winthrope, rising hastily to
repel the expected attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve got a little sand, too,&#8221; said Blake,
almost good-naturedly. &#8220;Say, that&#8217;s not so bad.
We&#8217;ll call it quits on the matches. Though how
you could go and throw them away&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>&#8220;Deuce take it, man! How should I know?
I&#8217;ve never before been in a wreck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither have I&#8211;this kind. But I tell you,
we&#8217;ve got to keep our think tanks going. It&#8217;s a
guess if we see to-morrow, and that&#8217;s no joke.
Now do you wonder I got hot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, no! I&#8217;ve been an ass, and here&#8217;s my
hand to it&#8211;if you really mean it&#8217;s quits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quits all right, long as you don&#8217;t run out
of sand,&#8221; responded Blake, and he gripped the
other&#8217;s soft hand until the Englishman winced.
&#8220;So; that&#8217;s settled. I&#8217;ve got a hot temper, but
I don&#8217;t hold grudges. Now, where&#8217;re your
fish?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;well, they were all spoiled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spoiled?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sun had shrivelled them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you call that spoiled! We&#8217;re like to eat
them rotten before we&#8217;re through with this picnic.
How about the pools?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pools? Do you know, Blake, I never thought
of the pools. I stopped to watch you, and then
we were so anxious about you&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake grunted, and turned on his heel to wade
into the half-drained pool in whose midst he had
been deposited by the hurricane.</p>

<p>Two or three small fish lay faintly wriggling
on the surface. As Blake splashed through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
water to seize them, his foot struck against a living
body which floundered violently and flashed
a brilliant forked tail above the muddy water.
Blake sprang over the fish, which was entangled
in the reeds, and with a kick, flung it clear out
upon the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;A coryphene!&#8221; cried Winthrope, and he
ran forward to stare at the gorgeously colored
prize.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coryphene?&#8221; repeated Blake, following his
example. &#8220;Good to eat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine as salmon. This is only a small one,
but&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifteen pounds, if an ounce!&#8221; cried Blake,
and he thrust his hand in his pocket. There was
a moment&#8217;s silence, and Winthrope, glancing up,
saw the other staring in blank dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up!&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost my knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When?&#8211;in the pool? If we felt about&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; aboard ship, or in the surf&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is my knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; almost big enough to whittle a match!
Mine would have done us some good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the best steel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; let&#8217;s see you cut up the fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you know, Blake, I shouldn&#8217;t know how
to go about it. I never did such a thing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>&#8220;And you, Miss Jenny? Girls are supposed
to know about cooking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never cooked anything in all my life, Mr.
Blake, and it&#8217;s alive,&#8211;and&#8211;and I am very
thirsty, Mr. Blake!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord!&#8221; commented Blake. &#8220;Give me that
knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though the blade was so small, the American&#8217;s
hand was strong. After some little haggling, the
coryphene was killed and dressed. Blake washed
both it and his hands in the pool, and began to
cut slices of flesh from the fish&#8217;s tail.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no fire,&#8221; Winthrope reminded him,
flushing at the word.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; assented Blake, in a cheerful
tone, and he offered Winthrope two of the pieces
of raw flesh. &#8220;Here&#8217;s your breakfast. The
trimmed piece is for Miss Leslie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s raw! Really, I could not think of
eating raw fish. Could you, Miss Leslie?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie shuddered. &#8220;Oh, no!&#8211;and I&#8217;m
so thirsty I could not eat anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet you can!&#8221; replied Blake. &#8220;Both
of you take that fish, and go to chewing. It&#8217;s
the stuff to ease your thirst while we look for
water. Good Lord!&#8211;in a week you&#8217;ll be glad
to eat raw snake. Finnicky over clean fish,
when you swallow canvas-back all but raw, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
beef running blood, and raw oysters with their
stomachs full of disintegrated animal matter, to
put it politely! You couldn&#8217;t tell rattlesnake
broth from chicken, and dog makes first-rate veal&#8211;when you&#8217;ve got to eat it. I&#8217;ve had it straight
from them that know, that over in France they
eat snails and fish-worms. It&#8217;s all a matter of
custom or the style.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure, the Japanese eat raw fish,&#8221; admitted
Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and you&#8217;d swallow your share of it if
you had an invite to a swell dinner in Tokio.
Go on now, both of you. It&#8217;s no joke, I tell you.
You&#8217;ve got to eat, if you expect to get to water
before night. Understand? See that headland
south? Well, it&#8217;s a hundred to one we&#8217;ll not
find water short of there, and if we make it by
night, we&#8217;ll be doing better than I figure from
the look of these bogs. Now go to chewing.
That&#8217;s it! That&#8217;s fine, Miss Jenny!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie had forced herself to take a nibble
of the raw fish. The flavor proved less repulsive
than she had expected, and its moisture was so
grateful to her parched mouth that she began to
eat with eagerness. Not to be outdone, Winthrope
promptly followed her lead. Blake had
already cut himself a second slice. After he had
cut more for his companions, he began to look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
them over with a closeness that proved embarrassing
to Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s more of the good stuff,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;While you&#8217;re chewing it, we&#8217;ll sort of take
stock. Everybody shell out everything. Here&#8217;s
my outfit&#8211;three shillings, half a dozen poker
chips, and not another blessed&#8211; Say, what&#8217;s
become of that whiskey flask? Have you seen
my flask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here it is, right beside me, Mr. Blake,&#8221; answered
Miss Leslie. &#8220;But it is empty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Might be worse! What you got?&#8211;hair-pins,
watch? No pocket, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None; and no watch. Even most of my
pins are gone,&#8221; replied the girl, and she raised
her hand to her loosely coiled hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, hold on to what you&#8217;ve got left.
They may come in for fish-hooks. Let&#8217;s see
your shoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie slowly thrust a slender little foot
just beyond the hem of her draggled white skirt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; groaned Blake, &#8220;slippers, and
high heels at that! How do you expect to walk
in those things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can at least try,&#8221; replied the girl, with
spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hobble! Pass &#8217;em over here, Winnie, my
boy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>The slippers were handed over. Blake took
one after the other, and wrenched off the heel
close to its base.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;ve at least got a pair of slippers,&#8221;
he said, tossing them back to their owner. &#8220;Tie
them on tight with a couple of your ribbons, if
you don&#8217;t want to lose them in the mud. Now,
Winthrope, what you got beside the knife?&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope held out a bunch of long flat keys
and his cigarette case. He opened the latter, and
was about to throw away the two remaining cigarettes
when Blake grasped his wrist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on! even they may come in for something.
We&#8217;ll at least keep them until we need
the case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the keys!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make arrow-heads, if we can get fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of savages making fire by rubbing
wood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and we&#8217;re a long way from being savages,&#8211;at
present. All the show we have is to
find some kind of quartz or flint, and the sooner
we start to look the better. Got your slippers
tied, Miss Jenny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I think they&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think! It&#8217;s knowing&#8217;s the thing. Here,
let me look.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl shrank back; but Blake stooped and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
examined first one slipper and then the other.
The ribbons about both were tied in dainty bows.
Blake jerked them loose and twisted them firmly
over and under the slippers and about the girl&#8217;s
slender ankles before knotting the ends.</p>

<p>&#8220;There; that&#8217;s more like. You&#8217;re not going
to a dance,&#8221; he growled.</p>

<p>He thrust the empty whiskey flask into his hip
pocket, and went back to pass a sling of reeds
through the gills of the coryphene.</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready now,&#8221; he called. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get a
move on. Keep my coat closer about your
shoulders, Miss Jenny, and keep your shade up,
if you don&#8217;t want a sunstroke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Blake, I&#8217;ll see to that,&#8221; said
Winthrope. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to help Miss Leslie
along. I&#8217;ve fastened our two shades together,
so that they will answer for both of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about yourself, Mr. Blake?&#8221; inquired
the girl. &#8220;Do you not find the sun fearfully
hot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure; but I wet my head in the sea, and
here&#8217;s another souse.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he rose with dripping head from beside the
pool, he slung the coryphene on his back, and
started off without further words.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>A JOURNEY IN DESOLATION</span></h2>

<p>Morning was well advanced, and the
sun beat down upon the three with
almost overpowering fierceness. The
heat would have rendered their thirst unendurable
had not Blake hacked off for them bit after bit of
the moist coryphene flesh.</p>

<p>In a temperate climate, ten miles over firm
ground is a pleasant walk for one accustomed to
the exercise. Quite a different matter is ten miles
across mud-flats, covered with a tangle of reeds
and rushes, and frequently dipping into salt
marsh and ooze. Before they had gone a mile
Miss Leslie would have lost her slippers had it
not been for Blake&#8217;s forethought in tying them so
securely. Within a little more than three miles
the girl&#8217;s strength began to fail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Blake,&#8221; called Winthrope, for the American
was some yards in the lead, &#8220;pull up a bit
on that knoll. We&#8217;ll have to rest a while, I
fancy. Miss Leslie is about pegged.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; demanded Blake. &#8220;We&#8217;re
not half-way yet!&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope did not reply. It was all he could
do to drag the girl up on the hummock. She
sank, half-fainting, upon the dry reeds, and he
sat down beside her to protect her with the shade.
Blake stared at the miles of swampy flats which
yet lay between them and the out-jutting headland
of gray rock. The base of the cliff was
screened by a belt of trees; but the nearest
clump of green did not look more than a mile
nearer than the headland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell!&#8221; muttered Blake, despondently. &#8220;Not
even a short four miles. Mush and sassiety
girls!&#8221;</p>

<p>Though he spoke to himself, the others heard
him. Miss Leslie flushed, and would have risen
had not Winthrope put his hand on her arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you not go on, and bring back a flask
of water for Miss Leslie?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;By that
time she will be rested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I don&#8217;t fetch back any flasks of water.
She&#8217;s going when I go, or you can come on to
suit yourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Blake, you&#8211;you won&#8217;t go, and leave me
here! If you have a sister&#8211;if your mother&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She died of drink, and both my sisters did
worse.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>&#8220;My God, man! do you mean to say you&#8217;ll
abandon a helpless young girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit more helpless than were my sisters
when you rich folks&#8217; guardians of law and order
jugged me for the winter, &#8217;cause I didn&#8217;t have a
job, and turned both girls into the street&#8211;onto
the street, if you know what that means&#8211;one
only sixteen and the other seventeen. Talk about
helpless young girls&#8211; Damnation!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie cringed back as though she had
been struck. Blake, however, seemed to have
vented his anger in the curse, for when he again
spoke, there was nothing more than impatience
in his tone. &#8220;Come on, now; get aboard. Winthrope
couldn&#8217;t lug you a half-mile, and long&#8217;s
it&#8217;s the only way, don&#8217;t be all day about it.
Here, Winthrope, look to the fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear fellow, I don&#8217;t quite take your
idea, nor does Miss Leslie, I fancy,&#8221; ventured
Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve got to get to water, or die; and
as the lady can&#8217;t walk, she&#8217;s going on my back.
It&#8217;s a case of have-to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! I am not&#8211;I am not! I&#8217;d sooner die!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll find that easy enough, later
on, Miss Jenny. Stand by, Winthrope, to help
her up. Do you hear? Take the knife and fish,
and lend a hand.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>There was a note in Blake&#8217;s voice that neither
Winthrope nor Miss Leslie dared disregard.
Though scarlet with mortification, she permitted
herself to be taken pick-a-back upon Blake&#8217;s broad
shoulders, and meekly obeyed his command to
clasp her hands about his throat. Yet even at
that moment, such are the inconsistencies of human
nature, she could not but admire the ease
with which he rose under her weight.</p>

<p>Now that he no longer had the slow pace of the
girl to consider, he advanced at his natural gait,
the quick, tireless stride of an American railroad-surveyor.
His feet, trained to swamp travel in
Louisiana and Panama, seemed to find the firmest
ground as by instinct, and whether on the half-dried
mud of the hummocks or in the ankle-deep
water of the bogs, they felt their way without
slip or stumble.</p>

<p>Winthrope, though burdened only with the
half-eaten coryphene, toiled along behind, greatly
troubled by the mud and the tangled reeds, and
now and then flung down by some unlucky misstep.
His modish suit, already much damaged
by the salt water, was soon smeared afresh with
a coating of greenish slime. His one consolation
was that Blake, after jeering at his first tumble,
paid no more attention to him. On the other
hand, he was cut by the seeming indifference
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
of Miss Leslie. Intent on his own misery, he
failed to consider that the girl might be suffering
far greater discomfort and humiliation.</p>

<p>More than three miles had been covered before
Blake stopped on a hummock. Releasing Miss
Leslie, he stretched out on the dry crest of the
knoll, and called for a slice of the fish. At his
urging, the others took a few mouthfuls, although
their throats were now so parched that even the
moist flesh afforded scant relief. Fortunately for
them all, Blake had been thoroughly trained to
endure thirst. He rested less than ten minutes;
then, taking Miss Leslie up again like a rag doll,
he swung away at a good pace.</p>

<p>The trees were less than half a mile distant
when he halted for the second time. He would
have gone to them without a pause though his
muscles were quivering with exhaustion, had not
Miss Leslie chanced to look around and discover
that Winthrope was no longer following them.
For the last mile he had been lagging farther and
farther behind, and now he had suddenly disappeared.
At the girl&#8217;s dismayed exclamation,
Blake released his hold, and she found herself
standing in a foot or more of mud and water.
The sweat was streaming down Blake&#8217;s face.
As he turned around, he wiped it off with his
shirtsleeves.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>&#8220;Do you&#8211;can it be, Mr. Blake, that he has
had a sunstroke?&#8221; asked Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sunstroke? No; he&#8217;s just laid down, that&#8217;s
all. I thought he had more sand&#8211;confound
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the sun is so dreadfully hot, and I have
his shade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s been tumbling into every other
pool. No; it&#8217;s not the sun. I&#8217;ve half a mind
to let him lie&#8211;the paper-legged swell! It
would no more than square our aboard-ship
accounts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely, you would not do that, Mr. Blake!
It may be that he has hurt himself in falling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In this mud?&#8211;bah! But I guess I&#8217;m in
for the pack-mule stunt all around. Now, now;
don&#8217;t yowl, Miss Jenny. I&#8217;m going. But you
can&#8217;t expect me to love the snob.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he splashed away on the return trail, Miss
Leslie dabbed at her eyes to check the starting
tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear&#8211;Oh, dear!&#8221; she moaned; &#8220;what
have I done, to be so treated? Such a brute,
Oh, dear!&#8211;and I am so thirsty!&#8221;</p>

<p>In her despair she would have sunk down
where she stood had not the sliminess of the
water repelled her. She gazed longingly at the
trees, in the fore of which stood a grove of stately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
palms. The half-mile seemed an insuperable distance,
but the ride on Blake&#8217;s back had rested
her, and thirst goaded her forward.</p>

<p>Stumbling and slipping, she waded on across
the inundated ground, and came out upon a half-baked
mud-flat, where the walking was much
easier. But the sun was now almost directly
overhead, and between her thirst and the heat,
she soon found herself faltering. She tottered on
a few steps farther, and then stopped, utterly
spent As she sank upon the dried rushes, she
glanced around, and was vaguely conscious of a
strange, double-headed figure following her path
across the marsh. All about her became black.</p>

<p>The next she knew, Blake was splashing her
head and face with brackish water out of the
whiskey flask. She raised her hand to shield her
face, and sat up, sick and dizzy.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; said Blake. He spoke in a
kindly tone, though his voice was harsh and
broken with thirst. &#8220;You&#8217;re all right now.
Pull yourself together, and we&#8217;ll get to the trees
in a jiffy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Winthrope&#8211;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here, Miss Genevieve. It was only a
wrenched ankle. If I had a stick, Blake, I fancy
I could make a go of it over this drier ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And lay yourself up for a month. Come,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
Miss Jenny, brace up for another try. It&#8217;s only
a quarter-mile, and I&#8217;ve got to pack him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was gasping with thirst; yet she made
an effort, and assisted by Blake managed to gain
her feet. She was still dizzy; but as Blake
swung Winthrope upon his back, he told her to
take hold of his arm. Winthrope held the shade
over her head. Thus assisted, and sheltered
from the direct beat of the sun-rays, she tottered
along beside Blake, half unconscious.</p>

<p>Fortunately the remaining distance lay across
a stretch of bare dry ground, for even Blake had
all but reached the limit of endurance. Step by
step he labored on, staggering under the weight
of the Englishman, and gasping with a thirst
which his exertions rendered even greater than
that of his companions. But through the trees
and brush which stretched away inland in a wall
of verdure he had caught glimpses of a broad
stream, and the hope of fresh water called out
every ounce of his reserve strength.</p>

<p>At last the nearest palm was only a few paces
distant. Blake clutched Miss Leslie&#8217;s arm, and
dragged her forward with a rush, in a final outburst
of energy. A moment later all three lay
gasping in the shade. But the river was yet
another hundred yards distant. Blake waited
only to regain his breath; then he staggered up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
and went on. The others, unable to rise, gazed
after him in silent misery.</p>

<p>Soon Blake found himself rushing through the
jungle along a broad trail pitted with enormous
footprints; but he was so near mad with thirst
that he paid no heed to the spoor other than to
curse the holes for the trouble they gave him.
Suddenly the trail turned to the left and sloped
down a low bank into the river. Blind to all
else, Blake ran down the slope, and dropping
upon his knees, plunged his head into the water.</p>

<p>At first his throat was so dry that he could no
more than rinse his mouth. With the first swallow,
his swollen tongue mocked him with the salt,
bitter taste of sea-water. The tide was flowing!
He rose, sputtering and choking and gasping. He
stared around. There was no question that he
was on the bank of a river and would be certain
of fresh water with the ebb tide. But could he
endure the agony of his thirst all those hours?</p>

<p>He thought of his companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; he groaned, &#8220;they&#8217;re goners
anyway!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared dully up the river at the thousands
of waterfowl which lined its banks. Within close
view were herons and black ibises, geese, pelicans,
flamingoes, and a dozen other species of
birds of which he did not know the names. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
he sat as though in a stupor, and did not move
even when one of the driftwood logs on a mud-shoal
a few yards up-stream opened an enormous
mouth and displayed two rows of hooked fangs.
It was otherwise when the noontime stillness was
broken by a violent splashing and loud snortings
down-stream. He glanced about, and saw six or
eight monstrous heads drifting towards him with
the tide.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in&#8211; Whee! a whole herd of hippos!&#8221;
he muttered. &#8220;That&#8217;s what the holes
mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>The foremost hippopotamus was headed directly
for him. He glared at the huge head with
sullen resentment. For all his stupor, he perceived
at once that the beast intended to land;
and he sat in the middle of its accustomed path.
His first impulse was to spring up and yell at the
creature. Then he remembered hearing that a
white hunter had recently been killed by these
beasts on one of the South African lakes. Instead
of leaping up, he sank down almost flat, and
crawled back around the turn in the path. Once
certain that he was hidden from the beasts, he rose
to his feet and hastened back through the jungle.</p>

<p>He was almost in view of the spot where he
had left Winthrope and Miss Leslie, when he
stopped and stood hesitating.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; he muttered; &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell
her,&#8211;poor girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and pushed into the thicket. Forcing
a way through the tangle of thorny shrubs
and creepers, until several yards from the path,
he began to edge towards the face of the jungle,
that he might peer out at his companions, unseen
by them.</p>

<p>There was more of the thicket before him than
he had thought, and he was still fighting his way
through it, when he was brought to a stand by a
peculiar cry that might have been the bleat of a
young lamb: &#8220;Ba&#8211;ba!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that!&#8221; he croaked.</p>

<p>He stood listening, and in a moment he again
heard the cry, this time more distinctly: &#8220;Blak!&#8211;Blak!&#8221;</p>

<p>There could be no mistake. It was Winthrope
calling for him, and calling with a clearness of
voice that would have been physically impossible
half an hour since. Blake&#8217;s sunken eyes lighted
with hope. He burst through the last screen of
jungle, and stared towards the palm under which
he had left his companions. They were not
there.</p>

<p>Another call from Winthrope directed his gaze
more seaward. The two were seated beside a
fallen palm, and Miss Leslie had a large round
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
object raised to her lips. Winthrope was waving
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cocoanuts!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Come on!&#8221;</p>

<p>Three of the palms had been overthrown by
the hurricane, and when Blake came up, he found
the ground strewn with nuts. He seized the first
he came to; but Winthrope held out one already
opened. He snatched it from him, and placed
the hole to his swollen lips. Never had champagne
tasted half so delicious as that cocoanut
milk. Before he could drain the last of it
through the little opening, Winthrope had the
husks torn from the ends of two other nuts, and
the convenient germinal spots gouged open with
his penknife.</p>

<p>Blake emptied the third before he spoke.
Even then his voice was hoarse and strained.
&#8220;How&#8217;d you strike &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help it,&#8221; explained Winthrope.
&#8220;Hardly had you disappeared when I noticed
the tops of the fallen palms, and thought of the
nuts. There was one in the grass not twenty
feet from where we lay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky for you&#8211;and for me, too, I guess,&#8221;
said Blake. &#8220;We were all three down for the
count. But this settles the first round in our
favor. How do you like the picnic, Miss
Jenny?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>&#8220;Miss Leslie, if you please,&#8221; replied the girl,
with hauteur.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, say, Miss Jenny!&#8221; protested Blake,
genially. &#8220;We live in the same boarding-house
now. Why not be folksy? You&#8217;re free to call
me Tom. Pass me another nut, Winthrope.
Thanks! By the way, what&#8217;s your front name?
Saw it aboard ship&#8211;Cyril&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cecil,&#8221; corrected Winthrope, in a low tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cecil&#8211;Lord Cecil, eh?&#8211;or is it only The
Honorable Cecil?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear sir, I have intimated before that,
for reasons of&#8211;er&#8211;State&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; you&#8217;re travelling incog., in the
secret service. Sort of detective&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Detective!&#8221; echoed Winthrope, in a peculiar
tone.</p>

<p>Blake grinned. &#8220;Well, it is rawther a nawsty
business for your honorable ludship. But there&#8217;s
nothing like calling things by their right names.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right names&#8211;er&#8211;I don&#8217;t quite take you.
I have told you distinctly, my name is Cecil
Winthrope!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O-h-h! how lovely!&#8211;See-sill! See-seal!&#8211;Bet
they called you Sissy at school. English,
chum of mine told me your schools are corkers
for nicknames. What&#8217;ll we make it&#8211;Sis or
Sissy?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>&#8220;I prefer my patronymic, Mr. Blake,&#8221; replied
Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then; we&#8217;ll make it Pat, if that&#8217;s
your choice. I say, Pat, this juice is the stuff
for wetness, but it makes a fellow remember his
grub. Where&#8217;d you leave that fish?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, I can&#8217;t just say, but it must have
been where I wrenched my ankle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cawn&#8217;t just say! And what are we
going to eat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here are the cocoanuts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bright boy! go to the head of the class!
Just take some more husk off those empty ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope caught up one of the nuts, and with
the aid of his knife, stripped it of its husk. At a
gesture from Blake, he laid it on the bare ground,
and the American burst it open with a blow of
his heel. It was an immature nut, and the meat
proved to be little thicker than clotted cream.
Blake divided it into three parts, handing Miss
Leslie the cleanest.</p>

<p>Though his companions began with more restraint,
they finished their shares with equal
gusto. Winthrope needed no further orders to
return to his husking. One after another, the
nuts were cracked and divided among the three,
until even Blake could not swallow another
mouthful of the luscious cream.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>Toward the end Miss Leslie had become
drowsy. At Winthrope&#8217;s urging, she now lay
down for a nap, Blake&#8217;s coat serving as a pillow.
She fell asleep while Winthrope was yet arranging
it for her. Blake had turned his back on her,
and was staring moodily at the hippopotamus
trail, when Winthrope hobbled around and sat
down on the palm trunk beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Blake,&#8221; he suggested, &#8220;I feel deuced
fagged myself. Why not all take a nap?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And when they awoke, they were all dead
men,&#8217;&#8221; remarked Blake.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, that sounds like a joke,&#8221; protested
the Englishman. &#8220;Don&#8217;t rag me now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Joke!&#8221; repeated Blake. &#8220;Why, that&#8217;s
Scripture, Pat, Scripture! Anyway, you&#8217;d think
it no joke to wake up and find yourself going
down the throat of a hippo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hippo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dozens of them over in the river. Shouldn&#8217;t
wonder if they&#8217;ve all landed, and &#8217;re tracking me
down by this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But hippopotami are not carnivorous&#8211;they&#8217;re
not at all dangerous, unless one wounds them,
out in the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be; but I&#8217;m not taking chances.
They&#8217;ve got mouths like sperm whales&#8211;I saw
one take a yawn. Another thing, that bayou is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
chuck full of alligators, and a fellow down on the
Rand told me they&#8217;re like the Central American
gavials for keenness to nip a swimmer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They will not come out on this dry land.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose they won&#8217;t&#8211;there&#8217;re no other animals
in Africa but sheep, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can we do? The captain told me that
there are both lions and leopards on this coast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice place for them, too, around these trees,&#8221;
added Blake. &#8220;Lucky for us, they&#8217;re night-birds
mostly,&#8211;if that Rand fellow didn&#8217;t lie.
He was a Boer, so I guess he ought to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure. It&#8217;s a nasty fix we&#8217;re in for
to-night. Could we not build some kind of a
barricade?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With a penknife! Guess we&#8217;ll roost in a
tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But cannot leopards climb? It seems to me
that I have heard&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about lions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They cannot; I&#8217;m sure of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll chance the leopards. Just stretch
out here, and nurse that ankle of yours. I don&#8217;t
want to be lugging you all year. I&#8217;m going to
hunt a likely tree.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE RE-ASCENT OF MAN</span></h2>

<p>Afternoon was far advanced, and Winthrope
was beginning to feel anxious,
when at last Blake pushed out from
among the close thickets. As he approached, he
swung an unshapely club of green wood, pausing
every few paces to test its weight and balance
on a bush or knob of dirt.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; called Winthrope; &#8220;that&#8217;s not half
bad! You look as if you could bowl over an ox.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake showed that he was flattered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he responded; &#8220;the
thing&#8217;s blamed unhandy. Just the same, I guess
we&#8217;ll be ready for callers to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Show you later, Pat, me b&#8217;y. Now trot out
some nuts. We&#8217;ll feed before we move camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Leslie is still sleeping.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Time, then, to roust her out. Hey, Miss
Jenny, turn out! Time to chew.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie sat up and gazed around in bewilderment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Miss Genevieve,&#8221; reassured Winthrope.
&#8220;Blake has found a safe place for the
night, and he wishes us to eat before we leave here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Save lugging the grub,&#8221; added Blake. &#8220;Get
busy, Pat.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Winthrope caught up a nut, the girl began
to arrange her disordered hair and dress with the
deft and graceful movements of a woman thoroughly
trained in the art of self-adornment.
There was admiration in Blake&#8217;s deep eyes as he
watched her dainty preening. She was not a
beautiful girl&#8211;at present she could hardly be
termed pretty; yet even in her draggled, muddy
dress she retained all the subtle charms of culture
which appeal so strongly to a man. Blake was
subdued. His feelings even carried him so far as
an attempt at formal politeness, when they had
finished their meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Leslie,&#8221; he began, &#8220;it&#8217;s little more
than half an hour to sundown; so, if you please,
if you&#8217;re quite ready, we&#8217;d best be starting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it far?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so very. But we&#8217;ve got to chase through
the jungle. Are you sure you&#8217;re quite ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite, thank you. But how about Mr. Winthrope&#8217;s
ankle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll ride as far as the trees. I can&#8217;t squeeze
through with him, though.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>&#8220;I shall walk all the way,&#8221; put in Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you won&#8217;t. Climb aboard,&#8221; replied
Blake, and catching up his club, he stooped
for Winthrope to mount his back. As he rose
with his burden, Miss Leslie caught sight of
his coat, which still lay in a roll beside the palm
trunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about your coat, Mr. Blake?&#8221; she
asked. &#8220;Should you not put it on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I&#8217;m loaded now. Have to ask you to
look after it. You may need it before morning,
anyway. If the dews here are like those in
Central America, they are d-darned liable to
bring on malarial fever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing more was said until they had crossed
the open space between the palms and the belt of
jungle along the river. At other times Winthrope
and Miss Leslie might have been interested
in the towering screw-palms, festooned to
the top with climbers, and in the huge ferns
which they could see beneath the mangroves, in
the swampy ground on their left. Now, however,
they were far too concerned with the question
of how they should penetrate the dense
tangle of thorny brush and creepers which rose
before them like a green wall. Even Blake hesitated
as he released Winthrope, and looked at
Miss Leslie&#8217;s costume. Her white skirt was of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
stout duck; but the flimsy material of her waist
was ill-suited for rough usage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better put the coat on, unless you want to
come out on the other side in full evening dress,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no use kicking; but I wish
you&#8217;d happened to have on some sort of a jacket
when we got spilled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there no path through the thicket?&#8221; inquired
Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only the hippo trail, and it don&#8217;t go our way.
We&#8217;ve got to run our own line. Here&#8217;s a stick
for your game ankle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope took the half-green branch which
Blake broke from the nearest tree, and turned to
assist Miss Leslie with the coat. The garment
was of such coarse cloth that as Winthrope drew
the collar close about her throat Miss Leslie
could not forego a little grimace of repugnance.
The crease between Blake&#8217;s eyes deepened, and
the girl hastened to utter an explanatory exclamation:
&#8220;Not so tight, Mr. Winthrope, please!
It scratches my neck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d find those thorns a whole lot worse,&#8221;
muttered Blake.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure; and Miss Leslie fully appreciates
your kindness,&#8221; interposed Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do indeed, Mr. Blake! I&#8217;m sure I never
could go through here without your coat.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right. Got the handkerchief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I put it in one of the pockets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll do to tie up your hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie took the suggestion, knotting the
big square of linen over her fluffy brown hair.</p>

<p>Blake waited only for her to draw out the
kerchief, before he began to force a way through
the jungle. Now and then he beat at the tangled
vegetation with his club. Though he held to the
line by which he had left the thicket, yet all his
efforts failed to open an easy passage for the
others. Many of the thorny branches sprang
back into place behind him, and as Miss Leslie,
who was the first to follow, sought to thrust them
aside, the thorns pierced her delicate skin, until
her hands were covered with blood. Nor did
Winthrope, stumbling and hobbling behind her,
fare any better. Twice he tripped headlong into
the brush, scratching his arms and face.</p>

<p>Blake took his own punishment as a matter of
course, though his tougher and thicker skin made
his injuries less painful. He advanced steadily
along the line of bent and broken twigs that
marked his outward passage, until the thicket
opened on a strip of grassy ground beneath a
wild fig-tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; exclaimed Winthrope, &#8220;a
banyan!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>&#8220;Banyan? Well, if that&#8217;s British for a daisy,
you&#8217;ve hit it,&#8221; responded Blake. &#8220;Just take a
squint up here. How&#8217;s that for a roost?&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope and Miss Leslie stared up dubiously
at the edge of a bed of reeds gathered in the
hollow of one of the huge flattened branches at
its junction with the main trunk of the banyan,
twenty feet above them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will not the mosquitoes pester us, here
among the trees?&#8221; objected Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Storm must have blown &#8217;em away. I haven&#8217;t
seen any yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be millions after sunset.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe; but I bet they keep below our roost&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how are we to get up so high?&#8221; inquired
Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can swarm this drop root, and I&#8217;ve a creeper
ready for you two,&#8221; explained Blake.</p>

<p>Suiting action to words, he climbed up the
small trunk of the air root, and swung over into
the hollow where he had piled the reeds. Across
the broad limb dangled a rope-like creeper, one
end of which he had fastened to a branch higher
up. He flung down the free end to Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look lively, Pat,&#8221; he called. &#8220;The sun&#8217;s
most gone, and the twilight don&#8217;t last all night in
these parts. Get the line around Miss Leslie,
and do what you can on a boost.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>&#8220;I see; but, you know, the vine is too stiff
to tie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake stifled an oath, and jerked the end of the
creeper up into his hand. When he threw it down
again, it was looped around and fastened in a
bowline knot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Leslie, get aboard, and we&#8217;ll have
you up in a jiffy,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure you can lift me?&#8221; asked the girl,
as Winthrope slipped the loop over her shoulders.</p>

<p>Blake laughed down at them. &#8220;Well, I guess
yes! Once hoisted a fellow out of a fifty-foot
prospect hole&#8211;big fat Dutchman at that. You
don&#8217;t weigh over a hundred and twenty.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had stretched out across the broadest part of
the branch. As Miss Leslie seated herself in the
loop, he reached down and began to haul up on
the creeper, hand over hand. Though frightened
by the novel manner of ascent, the girl clung
tightly to the line above her head, and Blake had
no difficulty in raising her until she swung directly
beneath him. Here, however, he found himself
in a quandary. The girl seemed as helpless as a
child, and he was lying flat. How could he lift
her above the level of the branch?</p>

<p>&#8220;Take hold the other line,&#8221; he said. The girl
hesitated. &#8220;Do you hear? Grab it quick, and
pull up hard, if you don&#8217;t want a tumble!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>The girl seized the part of the creeper which
was fastened above, and drew herself up with
convulsive energy. Instantly Blake rose to his
knees, and grasping the taut creeper with one
hand, reached down with the other, to swing the
girl up beside him on the branch.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Miss Jenny,&#8221; he reassured her as
he felt her tremble. &#8220;Sorry to scare you, but I
couldn&#8217;t have made it without. Now, if you&#8217;ll
just hold down my legs, we&#8217;ll soon hoist his
ludship.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had seated her in the broadest part of the
shallow hollow, where the branch joined the main
trunk of the fig. Heaped with the reeds which
he had gathered during the afternoon, it made
such a cozy shelter that she at once forgot her
dizziness and fright. Nestling among the reeds,
she leaned over and pressed down on his ankles
with all her strength.</p>

<p>The loose end of the creeper had fallen to the
ground when Blake lifted her upon the branch,
and Winthrope was already slipping into the
loop. Blake ordered him to take it off, and send
up the club. As the creeper was again flung
down, a black shadow swept over the jungle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! Sunset!&#8221; called Blake. &#8220;Look sharp,
there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready,&#8221; responded Winthrope.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>Blake drew in a full breath, and began to hoist.
The position was an awkward one, and Winthrope
weighed thirty or forty pounds more than Miss
Leslie. But as the Englishman came within
reach of the descending loop, he grasped it and
did what he could to ease Blake&#8217;s efforts. A few
moments found him as high above the ground
as Blake could raise him. Without waiting for
orders, he swung himself upon the upper part
of the creeper, and climbed the last few feet
unaided. Blake grunted with satisfaction as he
pulled him in upon the branch.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may do, after all,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At any
rate, we&#8217;re all aboard for the night; and none
too soon. Hear that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lion, I guess&#8211;Not that yelping. Listen!&#8221;</p>

<p>The brief twilight was already fading into the
darkness of a moonless night, and as the three
crouched together in their shallow nest, they were
soon made audibly aware of the savage nature of
their surroundings. With the gathering night
the jungle wakened into full life. From all sides
came the harsh squawking of birds, the weird
cries of monkeys and other small creatures, the
crash of heavy animals moving through the
jungle, and above all the yelp and howl and roar
of beasts of prey.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>After some contention with Winthrope, Blake
conceded that the roars of his lion might be
nothing worse than the snorting of the hippopotami
as they came out to browse for the night.
In this, however, there was small comfort, since
Winthrope presently reasserted his belief in the
climbing ability of leopards, and expressed his
opinion that, whether or not there were lions in
the neighborhood, certain of the barking roars
they could hear came from the throats of the
spotted climbers. Even Blake&#8217;s hair bristled as
his imagination pictured one of the great cats
creeping upon them in the darkness from the far
end of their nest limb, or leaping down out of
the upper branches.</p>

<p>The nerves of all three were at their highest
tension when a dark form swept past through the
air within a yard of their faces. Miss Leslie
uttered a stifled scream, and Blake brandished his
club. But Winthrope, who had caught a glimpse
of the creature&#8217;s shape, broke into a nervous
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a fruit bat,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;They
feed on the banyan figs, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the reaction from this false alarm, both men
relaxed, and began to yield to the effects of the
tramp across the mud-flats. Arranging the reeds
as best they could, they stretched out on either
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
side of Miss Leslie, and fell asleep in the middle
of an argument on how the prospective leopard
was most likely to attack.</p>

<p>Miss Leslie remained awake for two or three
hours longer. Naturally she was more nervous
than her companions, and she had been refreshed
by her afternoon&#8217;s nap. Her nervousness was
not entirely due to the wild beasts. Though
Blake had taken pains to secure himself and his
companions in loops of the creeper, fastened to
the branch above, Winthrope moved about so
restlessly in his sleep that the girl feared he
would roll from the hollow.</p>

<p>At last her limbs became so cramped that she
was compelled to change her position. She
leaned back upon her elbow, determined to rise
again and maintain her watch the moment she
was rested. But sleep was close upon her.
There was a lull in the louder noises of the
jungle. Her eyes closed, and her head sank
lower. In a little time it was lying upon Winthrope&#8217;s
shoulder, and she was fast asleep.</p>

<p>As Blake had asserted, the mosquitoes had
either been blown away by the cyclone, or did
not fly to such a height. None came to trouble
the exhausted sleepers.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>MAN AND GENTLEMAN</span></h2>

<p>Night had almost passed, and all three,
soothed by the refreshing coolness which
preceded the dawn, were sleeping their
soundest, when a sudden fierce roar followed
instantly by a piercing squeal caused even Blake
to start up in panic. Miss Leslie, too terrified to
scream, clung to Winthrope, who crouched on his
haunches, little less overcome.</p>

<p>Blake was the first to recover and puzzle out
the meaning of the crashing in the jungle and the
ferocious growls directly beneath them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lie still,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;We&#8217;re all right.
It&#8217;s only a beast that&#8217;s killed something down
below us.&#8221;</p>

<p>All sat listening, and as the noise of the animals
in the thicket died away, they could hear the
beast beneath them tear at the body of its victim.</p>

<p>&#8220;The air feels like dawn,&#8221; whispered Winthrope.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon be able to see the brute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he us,&#8221; rejoined Blake.</p>

<p>In this both were mistaken. During the brief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
false dawn they were puzzled by the odd appearance
of the ground. The sudden flood of full
daylight found them staring down into a dense
white fog.</p>

<p>&#8220;So they have that here!&#8221; muttered Blake&#8211;&#8220;fever-fog!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beastly shame!&#8221; echoed Winthrope. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure the creature has gone off.&#8221;</p>

<p>This assertion was met by an outburst of snarls
and yells that made all start back and crouch
down again in their sheltering hollow. As before,
Blake was the first to recover.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bet you&#8217;re right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The big one
has gone off, and a pack of these African coyotes
are having a scrap over the bones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean jackals. It sounds like the nasty
beasts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t for that fog, I&#8217;d go down and get
our share of the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it not be very dangerous, Mr. Blake?&#8221;
asked Miss Leslie. &#8220;What a fearful noise!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve chased coyotes off a calf with a rope;
but that&#8217;s not the proposition. You don&#8217;t find
me fooling around in that sewer gas of a fog.
We&#8217;ll roost right where we are till the sun does
for it. We&#8217;ve got enough malaria in us already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will it be long, Blake?&#8221; asked Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh? Getting hungry this quick? Wait till
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
you&#8217;ve tramped around a week, with nothing to
eat but your shoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely, Mr. Blake, it will not be so bad!&#8221;
protested Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, Miss Jenny; but cocoanut palms don&#8217;t
blow over every day, and when those nuts are
gone, what are we going to do for the next
meal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could we not make bows?&#8221; suggested Winthrope.
&#8220;There seems to be no end of game
about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bows&#8211;and arrows without points! Neither
of us could hit a barn door, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We could practise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure&#8211;six weeks&#8217; training on air pudding.
I can do better with a handful of stones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we should go at once to the cliffs,&#8221; said
Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re talking&#8211;and it&#8217;s Pike Peak or
bust, for ours. Here&#8217;s one night to the good;
but we won&#8217;t last many more if we don&#8217;t get fire.
It&#8217;s flints we&#8217;re after now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could we not make fire by rubbing sticks?&#8221;
said Winthrope, recalling his suggestion of the
previous morning. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that natives
have no trouble&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So&#8217;ve I, and what&#8217;s more, I&#8217;ve seen &#8217;em do
it. Never could make a go of it myself, though.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>&#8220;But if you remember how it is done, we have
at least some chance&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give you ten to one odds! No; we&#8217;ll
scratch around for a flint good and plenty before
we waste time that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The mist is going,&#8221; observed Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no lie. Now for our coyotes. Where&#8217;s
my club?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve all left,&#8221; said Winthrope, peering
down. &#8220;I can see the ground clearly, and there
is not a sign of the beasts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are the bones&#8211;what&#8217;s left of them,&#8221;
added Blake. &#8220;It&#8217;s a small deer, I suppose.
Well, here goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw down his club, and dropped the loose
end of the creeper after it. As the line straightened,
he twisted the upper part around his leg,
and was about to slide to the ground, when he
remembered Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think you can make it alone?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>The girl held up her hands, sore and swollen
from the lacerations of the thorns. Blake looked
at them, frowned, and turned to Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Um! you got it, too, and in the face,&#8221; he
grunted. &#8220;How&#8217;s your ankle?&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope wriggled his foot about, and felt the
injured ankle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy it is much better,&#8221; he answered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
&#8220;There seems to be no swelling, and there is no
pain now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s lucky; though it will tune up later.
Take a slide, now. We&#8217;ve got to hustle our
breakfast, and find a way to get over the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How wide is it?&#8221; inquired Winthrope, gazing
at his swollen hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;About three hundred yards at high tide.
May be narrower at ebb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you not build a raft?&#8221; suggested Miss
Leslie.</p>

<p>Blake smiled at her simplicity. &#8220;Why not a
boat? We&#8217;ve got a penknife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I can swim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully for you! Guess, though, we&#8217;ll try
something else. The river is chuck full of alligators.
What you waiting for, Pat? We haven&#8217;t
got all day to fool around here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope twisted the creeper about his leg
and slid to the ground, doing all he could to favor
his hands. He found that he could walk without
pain, and at once stepped over beside Blake&#8217;s
club, glancing nervously around at the jungle.</p>

<p>Blake jerked up the end of the creeper, and
passed the loop about Miss Leslie. Before she
had time to become frightened, he swung her
over and lowered her to the ground lightly as a
feather. He followed, hand under hand, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
stood for a moment beside her, staring at the
dew-dripping foliage of the jungle. Then the remains
of the night&#8217;s quarry caught his eye, and
he walked over to examine them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Pat,&#8221; he called, &#8220;these don&#8217;t look like
deer bones. I&#8217;d say&#8211;yes; there&#8217;s the feet&#8211;it&#8217;s
a pig.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any tusks?&#8221; demanded Winthrope.</p>

<p>Miss Leslie looked away. A heap of bones,
however cleanly gnawed, is not a pleasant sight.
The skull of the animal seemed to be missing;
but Blake stumbled upon it in a tuft of grass,
and kicked it out upon the open ground. Every
shred of hide and gristle had been gnawed from
it by the jackals; yet if there had been any
doubt as to the creature&#8217;s identity, there was evidence
to spare in the savage tusks which projected
from the jaws.</p>

<p>&#8220;Je-rusalem!&#8221; observed Blake; &#8220;this old
boar must have been something of a scrapper his
own self.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In India they have been known to kill a
tiger. Can you knock out the tusks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you said we had nothing for arrow
points&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good boy! We&#8217;ll cinch them, and ask
questions later.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>A few blows with the club loosened the tusks.
Blake handed them over to Winthrope, together
with the whiskey flask, and led the way to the
half-broken path through the thicket. A free
use of his club made the path a little more
worthy of the name, and as there was less need
of haste than on the previous evening, Winthrope
and Miss Leslie came through with only a few
fresh scratches. Once on open ground again,
they soon gained the fallen palms.</p>

<p>At a word from Blake, Miss Leslie hastened
to fetch nuts for Winthrope to husk and open.
Blake, who had plucked three leaves from a fan
palm near the edge of the jungle, began to split
long shreds from one of the huge leaves of a
cocoanut palm. This gave him a quantity of
coarse, stiff fibre, part of which he twisted in a
cord and used to tie one of the leaves of the fan
palm over his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that for a bonnet?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>The improvised head-gear bore so grotesque a
resemblance to a recent type of picture hat that
Winthrope could not repress a derisive laugh.
Miss Leslie, however, examined the hat and gave
her opinion without a sign of amusement. &#8220;I
think it is splendid, Mr. Blake. If we must go
out in the sun again, it is just the thing to protect
one.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>&#8220;Yes. Here&#8217;s two more I&#8217;ve fixed for you.
Ready yet, Winthrope?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Englishman nodded, and the three sat
down to their third feast of cocoanuts. They
were hungry enough at the start, and Blake
added no little keenness even to his own appetite
by a grim joke on the slender prospects of the
next meal, to the effect that, if in the meantime
not eaten themselves, they might possibly find
their next meal within a week.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if we must move, could we not take
some of the nuts with us?&#8221; suggested Winthrope.</p>

<p>Blake pondered over this as he ate, and when,
fully satisfied, he helped himself up with his club,
he motioned the others to remain seated.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are your hats and the strings,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;but you won&#8217;t need them now. I&#8217;m going
to take a prospect along the river; and while
I&#8217;m gone, you can make a try at stringing nuts
on some of this leaf fibre.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Blake, do you think it&#8217;s quite
safe?&#8221; asked Miss Leslie, and she glanced from
him to the jungle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Safe?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Well, nothing ate
you yesterday, if that&#8217;s anything to go by. It&#8217;s
all I know about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not wait for further protests. Swinging
his club on his shoulder, he started for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
break in the jungle which marked the hippopotamus
path. The others looked at each other, and
Miss Leslie sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If only he were a gentleman!&#8221; she complained.</p>

<p>Winthrope turned abruptly to the cocoanuts.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>AROUND THE HEADLAND</span></h2>

<p>It was mid morning before Blake reappeared.
He came from the mangrove swamp where
it ran down into the sea. His trousers were
smeared to the thigh with slimy mud; but as he
approached, the drooping brim of his palm-leaf
hat failed to hide his exultant expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; he called. &#8220;I&#8217;ve struck it. We&#8217;ll
be over in half an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bar,&#8221; answered Blake, hurrying forward.
&#8220;Sling on your hats, and get into my coat again,
Miss Jenny. The sun&#8217;s hot as yesterday. How
about the nuts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here they are. Three strings; all that I
fancied we could carry,&#8221; explained Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. The big one is mine, I suppose.
I&#8217;ll take two. We&#8217;ll leave the other. Lean on
me, if your ankle is still weak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks; I can make it alone. But must we
go through mud like that?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>&#8220;Not on this side, at least. Come on! We
don&#8217;t want to miss the ebb.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake&#8217;s impatience discouraged further inquiries.
He had turned as he spoke, and the others followed
him, walking close together. The pace
was sharp for Winthrope, and his ankle soon
began to twinge. He was compelled to accept
Miss Leslie&#8217;s invitation to take her arm. With
her help, he managed to keep within a few yards
of Blake.</p>

<p>Instead of plunging into the mangrove wood,
which here was undergrown with a thicket of
giant ferns, Blake skirted around in the open
until they came to the seashore. The tide was at
its lowest, and he waved his club towards a long
sand spit which curved out around the seaward
edge of the mangroves. Whether this was part
of the river&#8217;s bar, or had been heaped up by
the cyclone would have been beyond Winthrope&#8217;s
knowledge, had the question occurred to him. It
was enough for him that the sand was smooth and
hard as a race track.</p>

<p>Presently the party came to the end of the spit,
where the river water rippled over the sand with
the last feeble out-suck of the ebb. On their
right they had a sweeping view of the river,
around the flank of the mangrove screen. Blake
halted at the edge of the water, and half turned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>&#8220;Close up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s shallow enough;
but do you see those logs over on the mud-bank?
Those are alligators.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy!&#8211;and you expect me to wade among
such creatures?&#8221; cried Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went almost across an hour ago, and they
didn&#8217;t bother me any. Come on! There&#8217;s wind
in that cloud out seaward. Inside half an hour
the surf&#8217;ll be rolling up on this bar like all
Niagara.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we must, we must, Miss Genevieve,&#8221; urged
Winthrope. &#8220;Step behind me, and gather up
your skirts. It&#8217;s best to keep one&#8217;s clothes dry
in the tropics.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl blushed, and retained his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I prefer to help you,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; called Blake, and he splashed out
into the water.</p>

<p>The others followed within arm&#8217;s-length, nervously
conscious of the rows of motionless reptiles
on the mud-flat, not a hundred yards distant.</p>

<p>In the centre of the bar, where the water was a
trifle over knee-deep, some large creature came
darting down-stream beneath the surface, and
passed with a violent swirl between Blake and
his companions. At Miss Leslie&#8217;s scream, Blake
whirled about and jabbed with his club at the
supposed alligator.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the brute? Has he got you?&#8221; he
shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; he went by!&#8221; gasped Winthrope.
&#8220;There he is!&#8221;</p>

<p>A long bony snout, fringed on either side by a
row of lateral teeth, was flung up into view.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sawfish!&#8221; said Blake, and he waded on across
the bar, without further comment.</p>

<p>Miss Leslie had been on the point of fainting.
The tone of Blake&#8217;s voice revived her
instantly.</p>

<p>There were no more scares. A few minutes
later they waded out upon a stretch of clean sand
on the south side of the river. Before them the
beach lay in a flattened curve, which at the far
end hooked sharply to the left, and appeared to
terminate at the foot of the towering limestone
cliffs of the headland. A mile or more inland
the river jungle edged in close to the cliffs; but
from there to the beach the forest was separated
from the wall of rock by a little sandy plain,
covered with creeping plants and small palms.
The greatest width of the open space was hardly
more than a quarter of a mile.</p>

<p>Blake paused for a moment at high-tide mark,
and Winthrope instantly squatted down to nurse
his ankle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Blake,&#8221; he said, &#8220;can&#8217;t you find me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
some kind of a crutch? It is only a few yards
around to those trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord! you haven&#8217;t been fool enough to
overstrain that ankle&#8211; Yes, you have. Dammit!
why couldn&#8217;t you tell me before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It did not feel so painful in the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I helped the best I could,&#8221; interposed Miss
Leslie. &#8220;I think if you could get Mr. Winthrope
a crutch&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Crutch!&#8221; growled Blake. &#8220;How long do
you think it would take me to wade through the
mud? And look at that cloud! We&#8217;re in for
a squall. Here!&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed the girl the smaller string of cocoanuts,
flung the other up the beach, and stooped
for Winthrope to mount his back. He then
started off along the beach at a sharp trot. Miss
Leslie followed as best she could, the heavy
cocoanuts swinging about with every step and
bruising her tender body.</p>

<p>The wind was coming faster than Blake had
calculated. Before they had run two hundred
paces, they heard the roar of rain-lashed water,
and the squall struck them with a force that
almost overthrew the girl. With the wind came
torrents of rain that drove through their thickest
garments and drenched them to the skin within
the first half-minute.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>Blake slackened his pace to a walk, and
plodded sullenly along beneath the driving down-pour.
He kept to the lower edge of the beach,
where the sand was firmest, for the force of the
falling deluge beat down the waves and held in
check the breakers which the wind sought to roll
up the beach.</p>

<p>The rain storm was at its height when they
reached the foot of the cliffs. The gray rock
towered above them, thirty or forty feet high.
Blake deposited Winthrope upon a wet ledge, and
straightened up to scan the headland. Here and
there ledges ran more than half-way up the rocky
wall; in other places the crest was notched by
deep clefts; but nowhere within sight did either
offer a continuous path to the summit. Blake
grunted with disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;d take a fire ladder to get up this side,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to try the other, if we can
get around the point. I&#8217;m going on ahead. You
can follow, after Pat has rested his ankle. Keep
a sharp eye out for anything in the flint line&#8211;quartz
or agate. That means fire. Another
thing, when this rain blows over, don&#8217;t let your
clothes dry on you. I&#8217;ve got my hands full
enough, without having to nurse you through
malarial fever. Don&#8217;t forget the cocoanuts, and
if I don&#8217;t show up by noon, save me some.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>He stooped to drink from a pool in the rock
which was overflowing with the cool, pure rainwater,
and started off at his sharpest pace.
Winthrope and Miss Leslie, seated side by side
in dripping misery, watched him swing away
through the rain, without energy enough to call
out a parting word.</p>

<p>Beneath the cliff the sand beach was succeeded
by a talus of rocky debris which in places sloped
up from the water ten or fifteen feet. The lower
part of the slope consisted of boulders and water-worn
stones, over which the surf, reinforced by
the rising tide, was beginning to break with an
angry roar.</p>

<p>Blake picked his way quickly over the smaller
stones near the top of the slope, now and then
bending to snatch up a fragment that seemed to
differ from the others. Finding nothing but limestone,
he soon turned his attention solely to the
passage around the headland. Here he had expected
to find the surf much heavier. But the
shore was protected by a double line of reefs, so
close in that the channel between did not show a
whitecap. This was fortunate, since in places the
talus here sank down almost to the level of low
tide. Even a moderate surf would have rendered
farther progress impracticable.</p>

<p>Another hundred paces brought Blake to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
second corner of the cliff, which jutted out in a
little point. He clambered around it, and stopped
to survey the coast beyond. Within the last few
minutes the squall had blown over, and the rain
began to moderate its down-pour. The sun,
bursting through the clouds, told that the storm
was almost past, and its flood of direct light
cleared the view.</p>

<p>Along the south side of the cliff the sea extended
in twice as far as on the north. From the
end of the talus the coast trended off four or five
miles to the south-southwest in a shallow bight,
whose southern extremity was bounded by a
second limestone headland. This ridge ran inland
parallel to the first, and from a point some little
distance back from the shore was covered with a
growth of leafless trees.</p>

<p>Between the two ridges lay a plain, open along
the shore, but a short distance inland covered
with a jungle of tall yellow grass, above which,
here and there, rose the tops of scrubby, leafless
trees and the graceful crests of slender-shafted
palms. Blake&#8217;s attention was drawn to the latter
by that feeling of artificiality which their
exotic appearance so often wakens in the mind
of the Northern-bred man even after long residence
in the tropics. But in a moment he
turned away, with a growl. &#8220;More of those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
darned feather-dusters!&#8221; He was not looking
for palms.</p>

<p>The last ragged bit of cloud, with its showery
accompaniment, drifted past before the breeze
which followed the squall, and the end of the
storm was proclaimed by a deafening chorus of
squawks and screams along the higher ledges of
the cliff. Staring upward, Blake for the first time
observed that the face of the cliff swarmed with
seafowl.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s luck!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Guess I haven&#8217;t
forgot how to rob nests. Bet our fine lady&#8217;ll shy
at sucking them raw! All the same, she&#8217;ll have
to, if I don&#8217;t run across other rock than this, poor
girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>He advanced again along the talus, and did not
stop until he reached the sand beach. There he
halted to make a careful examination, not only of
the loose debris, but of the solid rock above.
Finding no sign of flint or quartz, he growled out
a curse, and backed off along the beach, to get a
view of the cliff top. From a point a little beyond
him, outward to the extremity of the headland,
he could see that the upper ledges and the
crest of the cliff, as well, were fairly crowded
with seafowl and their nests. His smile of satisfaction
broadened when he glanced inland and
saw, less than half a mile distant, a wooded cleft
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
which apparently ran up to the summit of the
ridge. From a point near the top a gigantic
baobab tree towered up against the skyline like
a Brobdingnagian cabbage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, we may have a run for our money,
after all,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Shade, and no end
of grub, and, by the green of those trees, a
spring&#8211;limestone water at that. Next thing,
I&#8217;ll find a flint!&#8221;</p>

<p>He slapped his leg, and both sound and feeling
reminded him that his clothes were drenched.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess we&#8217;ll wait about that flint,&#8221; he said,
and he made for a clump of thorn scrub a little
way inland.</p>

<p>As the tall grass did not grow here within a
mile of the shore, there was nothing to obstruct
him. The creeping plants which during the
rainy season had matted over the sandy soil
were now leafless and withered by the heat of
the dry season. Even the thorn scrub was half
bare of leaves.</p>

<p>Blake walked around the clump to the shadiest
side, and began to strip. In quick succession,
one garment after another was flung across a
branch where the sun would strike it. Last
of all, the shoes were emptied of rainwater and
set out to dry. Without a pause, he then gave
himself a quick, light rub-down, just sufficient to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
invigorate the skin without starting the perspiration.</p>

<p>Physically the man was magnificent. His
muscles were wiry and compact, rather than
bulky, and as he moved, they played beneath
his white skin with the smoothness and ease of a
tiger&#8217;s.</p>

<p>After the rub-down, he squatted on his heels,
and spent some time trying to bend his palm-leaf
hat back into shape. When he had placed this
also out in the sun, he found himself beginning
to yawn. The dry, sultry air had made him
drowsy. A touch with his bare foot showed him
that the sand beneath the thorn bush had already
absorbed the rain and offered a dry surface.
He glanced around, drew his club nearer, and
stretched himself out for a nap.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE CLUB AGE</span></h2>

<p>It was past two o&#8217;clock when the sun, striking
in where Blake lay outstretched, began to
scorch one of his legs. He stirred uneasily,
and sat upright. Like a sailor, he was wide
awake the moment he opened his eyes. He
stood up, and peered around through the half
leafless branches.</p>

<p>Over the water thousands of gulls and terns,
boobies and cormorants were skimming and diving,
while above them a number of graceful
frigate birds&#8211;those swart, scarlet-throated pirates
of the air,&#8211;hung poised, ready to swoop
down and rob the weaker birds of their fish. All
about the headland and the surrounding water
was life in fullest action. Even from where he
stood Blake could hear the harsh clamor of the
seafowl.</p>

<p>In marked contrast to this scene, the plain was
apparently lifeless. When Blake rose, a small
brown lizard darted away across the sand. Otherwise
there was neither sight nor sound of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
living creature. Blake pondered this as he gathered
his clothes into the shade and began to
dress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like the siesta is the all-round style in
this God-forsaken hole,&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t
seen so much as a rabbit, nor even one land bird.
May be a drought&#8211;no; must be the dry season&#8211;
Whee, these things are hot! I&#8217;m thirsty
as a shark. Now, where&#8217;s that softy and her
Ladyship? &#8217;Fraid she&#8217;s in for a tough time!&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew on his shoes with a jerk, growled at
their stiffness, and club in hand, stepped clear of
the brush to look for his companions. The first
glance along the foot of the cliff showed him
Winthrope lying under the shade of the overhanging
ledges, a few yards beyond the sand
beach. Of Miss Leslie there was no sign. Half
alarmed by this, Blake started for the beach with
his swinging stride. Winthrope was awake, and
on Blake&#8217;s approach, sat up to greet him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he called. &#8220;Where have you been
all this time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sleep. Where&#8217;s Miss Leslie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s around the point.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake grinned mockingly. &#8220;Indeed! But I
fawncy she won&#8217;t be for long.&#8221;</p>

<p>He would have passed on, but Winthrope
stepped before him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go out there, Blake,&#8221; he protested.
&#8220;I&#8211;ah&#8211;think it would be better if I went.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; demanded Blake.</p>

<p>Winthrope hesitated; but an impatient movement
by Blake forced an answer: &#8220;Well, you
remember, this morning, telling us to dry our
clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I remember,&#8221; said Blake. &#8220;So you
want to serve as lady&#8217;s valet?&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope&#8217;s plump face turned a sickly yellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;ah&#8211;valet?&#8211;What do you mean, sir?
I protest&#8211;I do not understand you!&#8221; he stammered.
But in the midst, catching sight of Blake&#8217;s
bewildered stare, he suddenly flushed crimson,
and burst out in unrestrained anger: &#8220;You&#8211;you
bounder&#8211;you beastly cad! Any man with
an ounce of decency&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake uttered a jeering laugh&#8211; &#8220;Wow!
Hark, how the British lion r-r-ro-ars when his
tail&#8217;s twisted!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You beastly cad!&#8221; repeated the Englishman,
now purple with rage.</p>

<p>Blake&#8217;s unpleasant pleasantry gave place to a
scowl. His jaw thrust out like a bulldog&#8217;s, and
he bent towards Winthrope with a menacing
look. For a moment the Englishman faced him,
sustained by his anger. But there was a steely
light in Blake&#8217;s eyes that he could not withstand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
Winthrope&#8217;s defiant stare wavered and fell. He
shrank back, the color fast ebbing from his cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; growled Blake. &#8220;Guess you won&#8217;t
blat any more about cads! You damned hypocrite!
Maybe I&#8217;m not on to how you&#8217;ve been
hanging around Miss Leslie just because she&#8217;s an
heiress. Anything is fair enough for you swells.
But let a fellow so much as open his mouth about
your exalted set, and it&#8217;s perfectly dreadful, you
know!&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused for a reply. Winthrope only drew
back a step farther, and eyed him with a furtive,
sidelong glance. This brought Blake back to
his mocking jeer. &#8220;You&#8217;ll learn, Pat, me b&#8217;y.
There&#8217;s lots of things&#8217;ll show up different to
you before we get through this picnic. For one
thing, I&#8217;m boss here&#8211;president, congress, and
supreme court. Understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By what right, may I ask?&#8221; murmured
Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right!&#8221; answered Blake. &#8220;That hasn&#8217;t anything
to do with the question&#8211;it&#8217;s might. Back
in civilized parts, your little crowd has the drop
on my big crowd, and runs things to suit themselves.
But here we&#8217;ve sort of reverted to primitive
society. This happens to be the Club Age,
and I&#8217;m the Man with the Big Stick. See?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I myself sympathize with the lower classes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
Mr. Blake. Above all, I think it barbarous the
way they punish one who is forced by circumstances
to appropriate part of the ill-gotten gains
of the rich upstarts. But do you believe, Mr.
Blake, that brute strength&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet! Now shut up. Where&#8217;re the
cocoanuts?&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope picked up two nuts and handed them
over.</p>

<p>&#8220;There were only five,&#8221; he explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;m no captain of industry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, true; you said we had reverted to barbarism,&#8221;
rejoined Winthrope, venturing an attempt
at sarcasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky for you!&#8221; retorted Blake. &#8220;But
where&#8217;s Miss Leslie all this time? Her clothes
must have dried hours ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They did. We had luncheon together just
this side of the point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you did! Then why shouldn&#8217;t I go for
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I&#8211;there was a shaded pool around the
point, and she thought a dip in the salt water
would refresh her. She went not more than half
an hour ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s it. Well, while I eat, you go and
call her&#8211;and say, you keep this side the point.
I&#8217;m looking out for Miss Leslie now.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>Winthrope hurried away, clenching his fists
and almost weeping with impotent rage. Truly,
matters were now very different from what they
had been aboard ship. Fortunately he had not
gone a dozen steps before Miss Leslie appeared
around the corner of the cliff. He was scrambling
along over the loose stones of the slope without
the slightest consideration for his ankle. The
girl, more thoughtful, waved to him to wait for
her where he was.</p>

<p>As she approached, Blake&#8217;s frown gave place
to a look that made his face positively pleasant.
He had already drained the cocoanuts; now he
proceeded to smash the shells into small bits, that
he might eat the meat, and at the same time
keep his gaze on the girl. The cliff foot being
well shaded by the towering wall of rock, she
had taken off his coat, and was carrying it on her
arm; so that there was nothing to mar the effect of
her dainty openwork waist, with its elbow sleeves
and graceful collar and the filmy veil of lace over
the shoulders and bosom. Her skirt had been
washed clean by the rain, and she had managed
to stretch it into shape before drying.</p>

<p>Refreshed by a nap in the forenoon and by her
salt-water dip, she showed more vivacity than at
any time that Winthrope could remember during
their acquaintance. Her suffering during and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
since the storm had left its mark in the dark
circles beneath her hazel eyes, but this in no wise
lessened their brightness; while the elasticity of
her step showed that she had quite recovered her
well-bred ease and grace of movement.</p>

<p>She bowed and smiled to the two men impartially.
&#8220;Good-afternoon, gentlemen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same to you, Miss Leslie!&#8221; responded Blake,
staring at her with frank admiration. &#8220;You look
fresh as a daisy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Genial and sincere as was his tone, the familiarity
jarred on her sensitive ear. She colored as
she turned from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there anything new, Mr. Winthrope?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not, Miss Genevieve. Like ourselves,
Blake took a nap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but Blake first took a squint at the
scenery. Just see if you&#8217;ve got everything, and
fix your hats. We&#8217;ll be in the sun for half a mile
or so. Better get on the coat, Miss Leslie. It&#8217;s
hotter than yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me,&#8221; said Winthrope.</p>

<p>Blake watched while the Englishman held the
coat for the girl and rather fussily raised the
collar about her neck and turned back the sleeves,
which extended beyond the tips of her fingers.
The American&#8217;s face was stolid; but his glance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
took in every little look and act of his companions.
He was not altogether unversed in the
ways of good society, and it seemed to him that
the Englishman was somewhat over-assiduous in
his attentions.</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready, Blake,&#8221; remarked Winthrope,
finally, with a last lingering touch.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout time!&#8221; grunted Blake. &#8220;You&#8217;re fussy
as a tailor. Got the flask and cigarette case and
the knife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All safe, sir&#8211;er&#8211;all safe, Blake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you two follow me slow enough not to
worry that ankle. I don&#8217;t want any more of the
pack-mule in mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we going, Mr. Blake?&#8221; exclaimed
Miss Leslie. &#8220;You will not leave us again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a half-mile, Miss Jenny. There&#8217;s a
break in the ridge. I&#8217;m going on ahead to find
if it&#8217;s hard to climb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should we climb?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Food, for one thing. You see, this end of
the cliff is covered with sea-birds. Another thing,
I expect to strike a spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope you do! The water in the rain
pools is already warm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be dry in a day or two. Say, Winthrope,
you might fetch some of those stones&#8211;size
of a ball. I used to be a fancy pitcher when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
I was a kid, and we might scare up a rabbit or
something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I play cricket myself. But these stones&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better&#8217;n a gun, when you haven&#8217;t got the
gun. Come on. We&#8217;ll go in a bunch, after all,
in case I need stones.&#8221;</p>

<p>With due consideration for Winthrope&#8217;s ankle,&#8211;not for Winthrope,&#8211;Blake set so slow a pace
that the half-mile&#8217;s walk consumed over half an
hour. But his smouldering irritation was soon
quenched when they drew near the green thicket
at the foot of the cleft. In the almost deathlike
stillness of mid-afternoon, the sound of trickling
water came to their ears, clear and musical.</p>

<p>&#8220;A spring!&#8221; shouted Blake. &#8220;I guessed right.
Look at those green plants and grass; there&#8217;s
the channel where it runs out in the sand and
dries up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others followed him eagerly as he pushed
in among the trees. They saw no running water,
for the tiny rill that trickled down the ledges was
matted over with vines. But at the foot of the
slope lay a pool, some ten yards across, and overshadowed
by the surrounding trees. There was
no underbrush, and the ground was trampled bare
as a floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove,&#8221; said Winthrope; &#8220;see the tracks!
There must have been a drove of sheep about.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>&#8220;Deer, you mean,&#8221; replied Blake, bending to
examine the deeper prints at the edge of the pool.
&#8220;These ain&#8217;t sheep tracks. A lot of them are
larger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you not uncover the brook?&#8221; asked
Miss Leslie. &#8220;If animals have been drinking
here, one would prefer cleaner water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; assented Blake. &#8220;If you&#8217;re game for
a climb, and can wait a few minutes, we&#8217;ll get it
out of the spring itself. We&#8217;ve got to go up
anyway, to get at our poultry yard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a place that looks like a path,&#8221; called
Winthrope, who had circled about the edge of the
pool to the farther side.</p>

<p>Blake ran around beside him, and stared at the
tunnel-like passage which wound up the limestone
ledges beneath the over-arching thickets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Odd place, is it not?&#8221; observed Winthrope.
&#8220;Looks like a fox run, only larger, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too low for deer, though&#8211;and their hoofs
would have cut up the moss and ferns more.
Let&#8217;s get a close look.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, Blake stooped and climbed a few
yards up the trail to an overhanging ledge, four
or five feet high. Where the trail ran up over
this break in the slope the stone was bare of all
vegetation. Blake laid his club on the top of the
ledge, and was about to vault after it, when,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
directly beneath his nose, he saw the print of a
great catlike paw, outlined in dried mud. At the
same instant a deep growl came rumbling down
the &#8220;fox run.&#8221; Without waiting for a second
warning, Blake drew his club to him, and crept
back down the trail. His stealthy movements
and furtive backward glances filled his companions
with vague terror. He himself was hardly
less alarmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of the trees&#8211;into the open!&#8221; he exclaimed
in a hoarse whisper, and as they crept
away, white with dread of the unknown danger,
he followed at their heels, looking backward, his
club raised in readiness to strike.</p>

<p>Once clear of the trees, Winthrope caught Miss
Leslie by the hand, and broke into a run. In
their terror, they paid no heed to Blake&#8217;s command
to stop. They had darted off so unexpectedly
that he did not overtake them short of a
hundred yards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; he said, gripping Winthrope
roughly by the shoulder. &#8220;It&#8217;s safe enough
here, and you&#8217;ll knock out that blamed ankle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it? What did you see?&#8221; gasped
Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Footprint,&#8221; mumbled Blake, ashamed of his
fright.</p>

<p>&#8220;A lion&#8217;s?&#8221; cried Winthrope.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>&#8220;Not so large&#8211;&#8217;bout the size of a puma&#8217;s.
Must be a leopard&#8217;s den up there. I heard a
growl, and thought it about time to clear out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, we&#8217;d better withdraw around the
point!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Withdraw your aunty! There&#8217;s no leopard
going to tackle us out here in open ground this
time of day. The sneaking tomcat! If only I
had a match, I&#8217;d show him how we smoke rat
holes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Winthrope spoke of rubbing sticks to
make fire,&#8221; suggested Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make sweat, you mean. But we may as
well try it now, if we&#8217;re going to at all. The
sun&#8217;s hot enough to fry eggs. We&#8217;ll go back to
a shady place, and pick up sticks on the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though there was shade under the cliff within
some six hundred feet, they had to go some distance
to the nearest dry wood&#8211;a dead thorp-bush.
Here they gathered a quantity of branches,
even Miss Leslie volunteering to carry a load.</p>

<p>All was thrown down in a heap near the cliff,
and Blake squatted beside it, penknife in hand.
Having selected the dryest of the larger sticks,
he bored a hole in one side and dropped in a
pinch of powdered bark. Laying the stick in the
full glare of the sun, he thrust a twig into the
hole, and began to twirl it between his palms.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
This movement he kept up for several minutes;
but whether he was unable to twirl the twig fast
enough, or whether the right kind of wood or tinder
was lacking, all his efforts failed to produce a
spark.</p>

<p>Unwilling to accept the failure, Winthrope insisted
upon trying in turn, and pride held him to
the task until he was drenched with sweat. The
result was the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;Told you so,&#8221; jeered Blake from where he.
lay in the shade. &#8220;We&#8217;d stand more chance
cracking stones together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what shall we do now?&#8221; asked Miss
Leslie. &#8220;I am becoming very tired of cocoanuts,
and there seems to be nothing else around here.
Indeed, I think this is all such a waste of time.
If we had walked straight along the shore this
morning we might have reached a town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We might, Miss Jenny, and then, again, we
mightn&#8217;t. I happened to overhaul the captain&#8217;s
chart&#8211;Quilimane, Mozambique&#8211;that&#8217;s all for
hundreds of miles. Towns on this coast are
about as thick as hens&#8217;-teeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about native villages?&#8221; demanded
Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; maybe I&#8217;m fool enough to go
into a wild nigger town without a gun. Maybe
I didn&#8217;t talk with fellows down on the Rand.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>&#8220;But what shall we do?&#8221; repeated Miss Leslie,
with a little frightened catch in her voice.
She was at last beginning to realize what this
rude break in her sheltered, pampered life might
mean. &#8220;What shall we do? It&#8217;s&#8211;it&#8217;s absurd
to think of having to stay in this horrid country
for weeks or perhaps months&#8211;unless some ship
comes for us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Miss Leslie,&#8221; answered Blake,
sharply yet not unkindly; &#8220;suppose you just sit
back and use your thinker a bit. If you&#8217;re your
daddy&#8217;s daughter, you&#8217;ve got brains somewhere
down under the boarding-school stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t get huffy, please! It&#8217;s a question
of think, not of putting on airs. Here we
are, worse off than the people of the Stone Age.
They had fire and flint axes; we&#8217;ve got nothing
but our think tanks, and as to lions and leopards
and that sort of thing, it strikes me we&#8217;ve got
about as many on hand as they had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you and Mr. Winthrope should immediately
arm yourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8211;But we&#8217;ll leave that till later. What
else?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl gazed at the surrounding objects, her
forehead wrinkled in the effort at concentration.
&#8220;We must have water. Think how we suffered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
yesterday! Then there is shelter from wild
beasts, and food, and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right here under our hands, if we had
fire. Understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand about the water. You would
frighten the leopard away with the fire; and if it
would do that, it would also keep away the other
animals at night. But as for food, unless we return
for cocoanuts&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give it up! Keep your thinker going on
the side, while Pat tells us our next move. Now
that he&#8217;s got the fire sticks out of his head&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Blake, I wish you would drop that
name. It is no harder to say Winthrope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re off, there,&#8221; rejoined Blake. &#8220;But
look here, I&#8217;ll make it Win, if you figure out
what we ought to do next.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Blake, that would not be half bad.
They&#8211;er&#8211;they called me Win at Harrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That so? My English chum went to Harrow&#8211;Jimmy
Scarbridge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord James!&#8211;your chum?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He started in like you, sort of top-lofty.
But he chummed all right&#8211;after I took out a
lot of his British starch with a good walloping.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, really now, Blake, you can&#8217;t expect any
one with brains to believe that, you know!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I don&#8217;t know, you know,&#8211;and I don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
know if you&#8217;ve got any brains, you know.
Here&#8217;s your chance to show us. What&#8217;s our
next move?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, now, I have had no experience in
this sort of thing&#8211;don&#8217;t interrupt, please! It
seems to me that our first concern is shelter for
the night. If we should return to your tree nest,
we should also be near the cocoa palms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one side. Here&#8217;s the other. Bar
to wade across&#8211;sharks and alligators; then
swampy ground&#8211;malaria, mosquitoes, thorn
jungle. Guess the hands of both of you are still
sore enough, by their look.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If only I had a pot of cold cream!&#8221; sighed
Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;If only I had a hunk of jerked beef!&#8221; echoed
Blake.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, why couldn&#8217;t we chance it for the
night around on the seaward face of the cliff?&#8221;
asked Winthrope. &#8220;I noticed a place where the
ledges overhang&#8211;almost a cave. Do you think
it probable that any wild beast would venture
so close to the sea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say. Didn&#8217;t see any tracks; so we&#8217;ll
chance it for to-night. Next!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By morning I believe my ankle will be in
such shape that I could go back for the string of
cocoanuts which we dropped on the beach.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go myself, to-day, else we&#8217;ll have no
supper. Now we&#8217;re getting down to bedrock.
If those nuts haven&#8217;t been washed away by the
tide, we&#8217;re fixed for to-night; and for two meals,
such as they are. But what next? Even the rain
pools will be dried up by another day or so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are not sea-birds good to eat?&#8221; inquired
Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, if only we could climb the cliff&#8211;might
there not be another place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I&#8217;ve looked at both sides. What&#8217;s
more, that spotted tomcat has got a monopoly on
our water supply. The river may be fresh at
low tide; but we&#8217;ve got nothing to boil water
in, and such bayou stuff is just concentrated
malaria.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we must find water elsewhere,&#8221; responded
Miss Leslie. &#8220;Might we not succeed if
we went on to the other ridge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the ticket! You&#8217;ve got a headpiece,
Miss Jenny! It&#8217;s too late to start now. But
first thing to-morrow I&#8217;ll take a run down that
way, while you two lay around camp and see if
you can twist some sort of fish-line out of cocoanut
fibre. By braiding your hair, Miss Jenny,
you can spare us your hair-pins for hooks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Blake, I&#8217;m afraid&#8211;I&#8217;d rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
you&#8217;d take us with you. With that dreadful
creature so near&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know. Let&#8217;s see your feet?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie glanced at him, and thrust a
slender foot from beneath her skirt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Um-m&#8211;stocking torn; but those slippers are
tougher than I thought. Most of the way will
be good walking, along the beach. We&#8217;ll leave
the fishing to Pat&#8211;er&#8211;beg pardon&#8211;Win!
With his ankle&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, Blake, I&#8217;ll chance the ankle. Don&#8217;t
leave me behind. I give you my word, you&#8217;ll
not have to lug me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course, Mr. Winthrope must go with us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Fraid to go alone, eh?&#8221; demanded Blake,
frowning.</p>

<p>His tone startled and offended her; yet all he
saw was a politely quizzical lifting of her brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I be afraid, Mr. Blake?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>Blake stared at her moodily. But when she
met his gaze with a confiding smile, he flushed
and looked away.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he muttered; &#8220;well move camp
together. But don&#8217;t expect me to pack his ludship,
if we draw a blank and have to trek back
without food or water.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE LEOPARDS&#8217; DEN</span></h2>

<p>While Blake made a successful trip
for the abandoned cocoanuts, his
companions levelled the stones beneath
the ledges chosen by Winthrope, and
gathered enough dried sea-weed along the talus
to soften the hard beds.</p>

<p>Soothed by the monotonous wash of the sea
among the rocks, even Miss Leslie slept well.
Blake, who had insisted that she should retain
his coat, was wakened by the chilliness preceding
the dawn. Five minutes later they started on
their journey.</p>

<p>The starlight glimmered on the waves and
shed a faint radiance over the rocks. This and
their knowledge of the way enabled them to pick
a path along the foot of the cliff without difficulty.
Once on the beach, they swung along at
a smart gait, invigorated by the cool air.</p>

<p>Dawn found them half way to their goal.
Blake called a halt when the first red streaks
shot up the eastern sky. All stood waiting until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
the quickly following sun sprang forth from the
sea. Blake&#8217;s first act was to glance from one
headland to the other, estimating their relative
distances. His grunt of satisfaction was lost in
Winthrope&#8217;s exclamation, &#8220;By Jove, look at the
cattle!&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake and Miss Leslie turned to stare at the
droves of animals moving about between them
and the border of the tall grass. Miss Leslie was
the first to speak. &#8220;They can&#8217;t be cattle, Mr.
Winthrope. There are some with stripes. I do
believe they&#8217;re zebras!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get down!&#8221; commanded Blake. &#8220;They&#8217;re
all wild game. Those big ox-like fellows to the
left of the zebras are eland. Whee! wouldn&#8217;t
we be in it if we owned that water hole? I&#8217;ll bet
I&#8217;d have one of those fat beeves inside three
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How I should enjoy a juicy steak!&#8221; murmured
Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Raw or jerked?&#8221; questioned Blake.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is &#8216;jerked&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; I mean broiled&#8211;just red inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I prefer mine quite rare,&#8221; added Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way you&#8217;ll get it, damned rare&#8211;Beg
your pardon, Miss Jenny! Without fire,
we&#8217;ll have the choice of raw or jerked.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>&#8220;Horrors!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jerked meat is all right. You cut your game
in strips&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With a penknife!&#8221; laughed Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>Blake stared at her glumly. &#8220;That&#8217;s so.
You&#8217;ve got it back on me&#8211; Butcher a beef
with a penknife! We&#8217;ll have to take it raw,
and dog-fashion at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I heard of bamboo knives?&#8221; said
Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bamboo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I can&#8217;t say, but as I remember, it
seems to me that the varnish-like glaze&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silica? Say, that would cut meat. But
where in&#8211;where in hades are the bamboos?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I can&#8217;t say. Only I remember that
I have seen them in other tropical places, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meantime I prefer cocoanuts, until we
have a fire to broil our steaks,&#8221; remarked Miss
Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ditto, Miss Jenny, long&#8217;s we have the nuts
and no meat. I&#8217;m a vegetarian now&#8211;but
maybe my mouth ain&#8217;t watering for something
else. Look at all those chops and roasts and
stews running around out there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are making for the grass,&#8221; observed
Winthrope. &#8220;Hadn&#8217;t we better start?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>&#8220;Nuts won&#8217;t weigh so much without the shells.
We&#8217;ll eat right here.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were only a few nuts left. They were
drained and cracked and scooped out, one after
another. The last chanced to break evenly
across the middle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said Blake, &#8220;the lower part of
this will do for a bowl, Miss Jenny. When
you&#8217;ve eaten the cream, put it in your pocket.
Say, Win, have you got the bottle and keys
and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All safe&#8211;everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure, Mr. Winthrope?&#8221; asked Miss
Leslie. &#8220;Men&#8217;s pockets seem so open. Twice
I&#8217;ve had to pick up Mr. Blake&#8217;s locket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Locket?&#8221; echoed Blake.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ivory locket. Women may be curious,
Mr. Blake, but I assure you, I did not look
inside, though&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me&#8211;give it here&#8211;quick!&#8221; gasped
Blake.</p>

<p>Startled by his tone and look, Miss Leslie
caught an oval object from the side pocket of the
coat, and thrust it into Blake&#8217;s outstretched hand.
For a moment he stared at it, unable to believe
his eyes; then he leaped up, with a yell that
sent the droves of zebras and antelope flying into
the tall grass.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>&#8220;Oh! oh!&#8221; screamed Miss Leslie. &#8220;Is it a
snake? Are you bitten?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bitten?&#8211;Yes, by John Barleycorn! Must
have been fuzzy drunk to put it in my coat.
Always carry it in my fob pocket. What a
blasted infernal idiot I&#8217;ve been! Kick me, Win,&#8211;kick me hard!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Blake, what is it? I don&#8217;t quite take
you. If you would only&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire!&#8211;<i>fire!</i> Can&#8217;t you see? We&#8217;ve got
all hell beat! Look here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He snapped open the slide of the supposed
locket, and before either of his companions could
realize what he would be about, was focussing the
lens of a surveyor&#8217;s magnifying-glass upon the
back of Winthrope&#8217;s hand. The Englishman
jerked the hand away&#8211;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ow!</i> That burns!&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake shook the glass in their bewildered faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look there!&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;there&#8217;s fire;
there&#8217;s water; there&#8217;s birds&#8217; eggs and beefsteaks!
Here&#8217;s where we trek on the back trail. We&#8217;ll
smoke out that leopard in short order!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say, Blake&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I mean to do! Don&#8217;t worry. You can
hide with Miss Jenny on the point, while I
engineer the deal. Fall in.&#8221;</p>

<p>The day was still fresh when they found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
themselves back at the foot of the cliff. Here
arose a heated debate between the men. Winthrope,
stung by Blake&#8217;s jeering words, insisted
upon sharing the attack, though with no great
enthusiasm. Much to Blake&#8217;s surprise, Miss
Leslie came to the support of the Englishman.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Blake,&#8221; she argued, &#8220;you say it
will be perfectly safe for us here. If so, it will
be safe for myself alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can play this game without him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt. Yet if, as you say, you expect to
keep off the leopard with a torch, would it not be
well to have Mr. Winthrope at hand with other
torches, should yours burn out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; if I thought he&#8217;d be at hand after the
first scare.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope started off, almost on a run. At
that moment he might have faced the leopard
single-handed. Blake chuckled as he swung
away after his victim. Within ten paces, however,
he paused to call back over his shoulder:
&#8220;Get around the point, Miss Jenny, and if you
want something to do, try braiding the cocoanut
fibre.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie made no response; but she stood for
some time gazing after the two men. There was
so much that was characteristic even in this rear
view. For all his anger and his haste, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
Englishman bore himself with an air of well-bred
nicety. His trim, erect figure needed only a fresh
suit to be irreproachable. On the other hand, a
careless observer, at first glance, might have mistaken
Blake, with his flannel shirt and shouldered
club, for a hulking navvy. But there was nothing
of the navvy in his swinging stride or in the resolute
poise of his head as he came up with
Winthrope.</p>

<p>Though the girl was not given to reflection, the
contrast between the two could not but impress
her. How well her countryman&#8211;coarse, uncultured,
but full of brute strength and courage&#8211;fitted in with these primitive surroundings.
Whereas Winthrope . . . . and herself . . . .</p>

<p>She fell into a kind of disquieted brown study.
Her eyes had an odd look, both startled and
meditative,&#8211;such a look as might be expected
of one who for the first time is peering beneath
the surface of things, and sees the naked Realities
of Life, the real values, bared of masking conventions.
It may have been that she was seeking to
ponder the meaning of her own existence&#8211;that
she had caught a glimpse of the vanity and wastefulness,
the utter futility of her life. At the
best, it could only have been a glimpse. But
was not that enough?</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what use are such people as I?&#8221; she cried.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
&#8220;That man may be rough and coarse,&#8211;even a
brute; but he at least does things&#8211;I&#8217;ll show
him that I can do things, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>She hastened out around the corner of the cliff
to the spot where they had spent the night. Here
she gathered together the cocoanut husks, and
seating herself in the shade of the overhanging
ledges, began to pick at the coarse fibre. It was
cruel work for her soft fingers, not yet fully
healed from the thorn wounds. At times the
pain and an overpowering sense of injury brought
tears to her eyes; still more often she dropped the
work in despair of her awkwardness. Yet always
she returned to the task with renewed energy.</p>

<p>After no little perseverance, she found how to
twist the fibre and plait it into cord. At best it
was slow work, and she did not see how she
should ever make enough cord for a fish-line.
Yet, as she caught the knack of the work and her
fingers became more nimble, she began to enjoy
the novel pleasure of producing something.</p>

<p>She had quite forgot to feel injured, and was
learning to endure with patience the rasping of
the fibre between her fingers, when Winthrope
came clambering around the corner of the cliff.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she exclaimed, springing up and
hurrying to meet him. He was white and quivering,
and the look in his eyes filled her with dread.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>Her voice shrilled to a scream, &#8220;He&#8217;s dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;s hurt!&#8211;he&#8217;s hurt by that savage
creature, and you&#8217;ve run off and left him&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Miss Genevieve, I must insist! The
fellow is not even scratched.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why&#8211;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the horror of it all. It actually made
me ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You frightened me almost to death. Did the
beast chase you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would have been better, in a way.
Really, it was horrible! I&#8217;m still sick over it,
Miss Genevieve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But tell me about it. Did you set fire to the
bushes in the cleft, as Mr. Blake&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; after we had fetched what we could
carry of that long grass&#8211;two big trusses. It
grows ten or twelve feet tall, and is now quite
dry. Part of it Blake made into torches, and we
fired the bush all across the foot of the cleft.
Really, one would not have thought there was
that much dry wood in so green a dell. On
either side of the rill the grass and brush flared
like tinder, and the flames swept up the cleft far
quicker than we had expected. We could hear
them crackling and roaring louder than ever after
the smoke shut out our view.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>&#8220;Surely, there is nothing so very horrible in
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, oh, no; it was not that. But the beast&#8211;the leopard! At first we heard one roar; then
it was that dreadful snarling and yelling&#8211;most
awful squalling! . . . . The wretched thing came
leaping and tumbling down the path, all singed
and blinded. Blake fired the big truss of grass,
and the brute rolled right into the flames. It was
shocking&#8211;dreadfully shocking! The wretched
creature writhed and leaped about till it plunged
into the pool. . . . . When it sought to crawl out,
all black and hideous, Blake went up and killed
it with his club&#8211;crushed in its skull&#8211;Ugh!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie gazed at the unnerved Englishman
with calm scrutiny.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should you feel so about it?&#8221; she
asked. &#8220;Was it not the beast&#8217;s life against
ours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But so horrible a death!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure Mr. Blake would have preferred to
shoot the creature, had he a gun. Having nothing
else than fire, I think it was all very brave
of him. Now we are sure of water and food.
Had we not best be going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was to fetch you that Blake sent me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope spoke with perceptible stiffness.
He was chagrined, not only by her commendation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
of Blake, but by the indifference with which she
had met his agitation.</p>

<p>They started at once, Miss Leslie in the lead.
As they rounded the point, she caught sight of
the smoke still rising from the cleft. A little
later she noticed the vultures which were streaming
down out of the sky from all quarters other
than seaward. Their focal point seemed to be
the trees at the foot of the cleft. A nearer view
showed that they were alighting in the thorn
bushes on the south border of the wood.</p>

<p>Of Blake there was nothing to be seen until
Miss Leslie, still in the lead, pushed in among
the trees. There they found him crouched
beside a small fire, near the edge of the pool.
He did not look up. His eyes were riveted in a
hungry stare upon several pieces of flesh, suspended
over the flames on spits of green twigs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he sang out, as he heard their footsteps.
&#8220;Just in time, Miss Jenny. Your broiled
steak&#8217;ll be ready in short order.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, build up the fire! I&#8217;m simply ravenous!&#8221;
she exclaimed, between impatience and
delight.</p>

<p>Winthrope was hardly less keen; yet his
hunger did not altogether blunt his curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Blake,&#8221; he inquired, &#8220;where did you
get the meat?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>&#8220;Stow it, Win, my boy. This ain&#8217;t a packing
house. The stuff may be tough, but it&#8217;s not&#8211;er&#8211;the other thing. Here you are, Miss Jenny.
Chew it off the stick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though Winthrope had his suspicions, he took
the piece of half-burned flesh which Blake handed
him in turn, and fell to eating without further
question. As Blake had surmised, the roast
proved far other than tender. Hunger, however,
lent it a most appetizing flavor. The repast
ended when there was nothing left to devour.
Blake threw away his empty spit, and rose to
stretch. He waited for Miss Leslie to swallow
her last mouthful, and then began to chuckle.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the joke?&#8221; asked Winthrope.</p>

<p>Blake looked at him solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well now, that was downright mean of me,&#8221;
he drawled; &#8220;after robbing them, to laugh at
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robbing who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The buzzards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve fed us on leopard meat! It&#8217;s&#8211;it&#8217;s
disgusting!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I found it filling. How about you, Miss
Jenny?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie did not know whether to laugh or
to give way to a feeling of nausea. She did
neither.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>&#8220;Can we not find the spring of which you
spoke?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I am thirsty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess the fire is about burnt out,&#8221;
assented Blake. &#8220;Come on; we&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cleft now had a far different aspect from
what it had presented on their first visit. The
largest of the trees, though scorched about the
base, still stood with unwithered foliage, little
harmed by the fire. But many of their small
companions had been killed and partly destroyed
by the heat and flames from the burning brush.
In places the fire was yet smouldering.</p>

<p>Blake picked a path along the edge of the rill,
where the moist vegetation, though scorched, had
refused to burn. After the first abrupt ledge, up
which Blake had to drag his companions, the
ascent was easy. But as they climbed around
an outjutting corner of the steep right wall of the
cleft, Blake muttered a curse of disappointment.
He could now see that the cleft did not run to
the top of the cliff, but through it, like a tiny box
canyon. The sides rose sheer and smooth as
walls. Midway, at the highest point of the cleft,
the baobab towered high above the ridge crest,
its gigantic trunk filling a third of the breadth of
the little gorge. Unfortunately it stood close to
the left wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s luck for you!&#8221; growled Blake.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t the blamed old tree have grown
on the other side? We might have found a way
to climb it. Guess we&#8217;ll have to smoke out
another leopard. We&#8217;re no nearer those birds&#8217;
nests than we were yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, look here!&#8221; exclaimed Winthrope.
&#8220;This is our chance for antelope! Here by the
spring are bamboos&#8211;real bamboos,&#8211;and only
half the thicket burned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of them?&#8221; demanded Blake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bows&#8211;arrows&#8211;and did you not agree that
they would make knives?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Umph&#8211;we&#8217;ll see. What is it, Miss Jenny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a hole in the big tree?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like it. These baobabs are often
hollow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps that is where the leopard had his
den,&#8221; added Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t wonder. We&#8217;ll go and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Blake,&#8221; protested the girl, &#8220;may
there not be other leopards?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Might have been; but I&#8217;ll bet they lit out
with the other. Look how the tree is scorched.
Must have been stacks of dry brush around the
hole, &#8217;nough to smoke out a fireman. We&#8217;ll
look and see if they left any soup bones lying
around. First, though, here&#8217;s your drink, Miss
Jenny.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>As he spoke, Blake kicked aside some smouldering
branches, and led the way to the crevice
whence the spring trickled from the rock into a
shallow stone basin. When all had drunk their
fill of the clear cool water, Blake took up his
club and walked straight across to the baobab.
Less than thirty steps brought him to the narrow
opening in the trunk of the huge tree. At
first he could make out nothing in the dimly
lit interior; but the fetid, catty odor was enough
to convince him that he had found the leopards&#8217;
den.</p>

<p>He caught the vague outlines of a long body,
crouched five or six yards away, on the far side
of the hollow. He sprang back, his club brandished
to strike. But the expected attack did not
follow. Blake glanced about as though considering
the advisability of a retreat. Winthrope and
Miss Leslie were staring at him, white-faced.
The sight of their terror seemed to spur him to
dare-devil bravado; though his actions may
rather have been due to the fact that he realized
the futility of flight, and so rose to the requirements
of the situation&#8211;the grim need to stand
and face the danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get behind the bamboos!&#8221; he called, and as
they hurriedly obeyed, he caught up a stone and
flung it in at the crouching beast.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>He heard the missile strike with a soft thud
that told him he had not missed his mark, and he
swung up his club in both hands. Given half a
chance, he would smash the skull of the female
leopard as he had crushed her blinded mate. . . . .
One moment after another passed, and he stood
poised for the shock, tense and scowling. . . . .
Not so much as a snarl came from within. The
truth flashed upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smothered!&#8221; he yelled.</p>

<p>The others saw him dart in through the hole.
A moment later two limp grayish bodies were
flung out into the open. Immediately after,
Blake reappeared, dragging the body of the
mother leopard.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right; they&#8217;re dead!&#8221; cried Winthrope,
and he ran forward to look at the
bodies.</p>

<p>Miss Leslie followed, hardly less curious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they all dead, Mr. Blake?&#8221; she inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wiped out&#8211;whole family. The old cat
stayed by her kittens, and all smothered together&#8211;lucky for us! Get busy with those bamboos,
Win. I&#8217;m going to have these skins, and the
sooner we get the cub meat hung up and curing,
the better for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leopard meat again!&#8221; rejoined Winthrope.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>&#8220;Spring leopard, young and tender! What
more could you ask? Get a move on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I do anything, Mr. Blake?&#8221; asked Miss
Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hunt a shady spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I really mean it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if that&#8217;s straight, you might go on
along the gully, and see if there&#8217;s any place to
get to the top. You could pick up sticks on the
way back, if any are left. We&#8217;ll have to fumigate
this tree hole before we adopt it for a
residence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will it be long before you finish with your&#8211;with
the bodies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, look here, Miss Jenny; it&#8217;s going
to be a mess, and I wouldn&#8217;t mind hauling the
carcasses clear down the gully, out of sight, if
it was to be the only time. But it&#8217;s not, and
you&#8217;ve got to get used to it, sooner or later. So
we&#8217;ll start now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose, if I must, Mr. Blake&#8211; Really,
I wish to help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. That&#8217;s something like! Think you
can learn to cook?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See what I did this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake took the cord of cocoanut fibre which
she held out to him, and tested its strength.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be&#8211;blessed!&#8221; he said. &#8220;This <i>is</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
something like. If you don&#8217;t look out, you&#8217;ll
make quite a camp-mate, Miss Jenny. But now,
trot along. This is hardly arctic weather, and our
abattoir don&#8217;t include a cold-storage plant. The
sooner these lambs are dressed, the better.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>PROBLEMS IN WOODCRAFT</span></h2>

<p>It was no pleasant sight that met Miss
Leslie&#8217;s gaze upon her return. The neatest
of butchering can hardly be termed aesthetic;
and Blake and Winthrope lacked both skill and
tools. Between the penknife and an improvised
blade of bamboo, they had flayed the two cubs
and haggled off the flesh. The ragged strips,
spitted on bamboo rods, were already searing in
the fierce sun-rays.</p>

<p>Miss Leslie would have slipped into the hollow
of the baobab with her armful of fagots and
brush; but Blake waved a bloody knife above
the body of the mother leopard, and beckoned
the girl to come nearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on a minute, please,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What
did you find out?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie drew a few steps nearer, and forced
herself to look at the revolting sight. She found
it still more difficult to withstand the odor of the
fresh blood. Winthrope was pale and nauseated.
The sight of his distress caused the girl to forget
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
her own loathing. She drew a deep breath, and
succeeded in countering Blake&#8217;s expectant look
with a half-smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;How well you are getting along!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t think you could stand it. But you&#8217;ve
got grit all right, if you <i>are</i> a lady,&#8221; Blake
said admiringly. &#8220;Say, you&#8217;ll make it yet!
Now, how about the gully?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no place to climb up. It runs along
like this, and then slopes down. But there is a
cliff at the end, as high as these walls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty feet,&#8221; muttered Blake. &#8220;Confound
the luck! It isn&#8217;t that jump-off; but how in&#8211;how
are we going to get up on the cliff? There&#8217;s
an everlasting lot of omelettes in those birds&#8217;
nests. If only that bloomin&#8217;&#8211;how&#8217;s that, Win,
me b&#8217;y?&#8211;that bloomin&#8217;, blawsted baobab was
on t&#8217; other side. The wood&#8217;s almost soft as punk.
We could drive in pegs, and climb up the trunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are other trees beyond it,&#8221; remarked
Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then maybe we can shin up&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear the branches that overhang the cliff are
too slender to bear any weight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s too infernally high to climb up to
this overhanging baobab limb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; ventured Winthrope, &#8220;if we had a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
axe, now, we might cut up one of the trees, and
make a ladder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; and if we had a ladder, we might
climb up the cliff!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Blake, is there not some way to cut
down one of the trees? The tree itself would be
a ladder if it fell in such a way as to lean against
the cliff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only the penknife,&#8221; answered Blake.
&#8220;So I guess we&#8217;ll have to scratch eggs off our
menu card. Spring leopard for ours! Now, if
you really want to help, you might scrape the
soup bones out of your boudoir, and fetch a lot
more brush. It&#8217;ll take a big fire to rid the hole
of that cat smell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will not the tree burn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; these hollow baobabs have green bark
on the inside as well as out. Funny thing, that!
We&#8217;d have to keep a fire going a long time to
burn through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet it would burn in time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but we&#8217;re not going to&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why not burn through the trunk of
one of those small trees, instead of chopping it
down?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By&#8211;heck, Miss Jenny, you&#8217;ve got an
American headpiece! Come on. Sooner we get
the thing started, the better.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>Neither Winthrope nor Miss Leslie was reluctant
to leave the vicinity of the carcasses. They
followed close after Blake, around the monstrous
bole of the baobab. A little beyond it stood a
group of slender trees, whose trunks averaged
eight inches thick at the base. Blake stopped at
the second one, which grew nearest to the seaward
side of the cleft.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s our ladder,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Get some
firewood. Pound the bushes, though, before you
go poking into them. May be snakes here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Snakes?&#8211;oh!&#8221; cried Miss Leslie, and she
stood shuddering at the danger she had already
incurred.</p>

<p>The fire had burnt itself out on a bare ledge of
rock between them and the baobab, and the
clumps of dry brush left standing in this end of
the cleft were very suggestive of snakes, now
that Blake had called attention to the possibility
of their presence.</p>

<p>He laughed at his hesitating companions. &#8220;Go
on, go on! Don&#8217;t squeal till you&#8217;re bit. Most
snakes hike out, if you give them half a chance.
Take a stick, each of you, and pound the bushes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus urged, both started to work. But neither
ventured into the thicker clumps. When they
returned, with large armfuls of sticks and twigs,
they found that Blake had used his glass to light
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
a handful of dry bark, out in the sun, and was
nursing it into a small fire at the base of the tree,
on the side next the cliff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Jenny,&#8221; he directed, &#8220;you&#8217;re to
keep this going&#8211;not too big a fire&#8211;understand?
Same time you can keep on fetching
brush to fumigate your cat hole. It needs it, all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will not that be rather too much for Miss
Leslie?&#8221; asked Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if she&#8217;d rather come and rub brains on
the skins,&#8211;Indian tan, you know,&#8211;or&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you mention such things before a
lady?&#8221; protested Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg your pardon, Miss Leslie! you see, I&#8217;m
not much used to ladies&#8217; company. Anyway,
you&#8217;ve got to see and hear about these things.
And now I&#8217;ll have to get the strings for Win&#8217;s
bamboo bows. Come on, Win. We&#8217;ve got that
old tabby to peel, and a lot more besides.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie&#8217;s first impulse was to protest against
being left alone, when at any moment some
awful venomous serpent might come darting at
her out of the brush or the crevices in the rocks.
But her half-parted lips drew firmly together, and
after a moment&#8217;s hesitancy, she forced herself to
the task which had been assigned her. The fire,
once started, required little attention. She could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
give most of her time to gathering brush for the
fumigation of the leopard den.</p>

<p>She had collected quite a heap of fuel at the
entrance of the hollow, when she remembered that
the place would first have to be cleared of its accumulation
of bones. A glance at her companions
showed that they were in the midst of tasks even
more revolting. It was certainly disagreeable to
do such things; yet, as Mr. Blake had said, others
had to do them. It was now her time to learn.
She could see him smile at her hesitation.</p>

<p>Stung by the thought of his half contemptuous
pity, she caught up a forked stick, and forced
herself to enter the tree-cave. The stench met
her like a blow. It nauseated and all but overpowered
her. She stood for several moments in
the centre of the cavity, sick and faint. Had it
been even the previous day, she would have run
out into the open air.</p>

<p>Presently she grew a little more accustomed to
the stench, and began to rake over the soft dry
mould of the den floor with her forked stick.
Bones!&#8211;who had ever dreamed of such a mess
of bones?&#8211;big bones and little bones and skulls;
old bones, dry and almost buried; mouldy bones;
bones still half-covered with bits of flesh and
gristle&#8211;the remnants of the leopard family&#8217;s last
meal.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>At last all were scraped out and flung in a heap,
three or four yards away from the entrance. Miss
Leslie looked at the result of her labor with a
satisfied glance, followed by a sigh of relief. Between
the heat and her unwonted exercise, she
was greatly fatigued. She stepped around to a
shadier spot to rest.</p>

<p>With a start, she remembered the fire.</p>

<p>When she reached it there were only a few
dying embers left. She gathered dead leaves and
shreds of fibrous inner bark, and knelt beside the
dull coals to blow them into life. She could not
bear the thought of having to confess her carelessness
to Blake.</p>

<p>The hot ashes flew up in her face and powdered
her hair with their gray dust; yet she persisted,
blowing steadily until a shred of bark caught the
sparks and flared up in a tiny flame. A little
more, and she had a strong fire blazing against
the tree trunk.</p>

<p>She rested a short time, relaxing both mentally
and physically in the satisfying consciousness that
Blake never should know how near she had come
to failing in her trust.</p>

<p>Soon she became aware of a keen feeling of
thirst and hunger. She rose, piled a fresh supply
of sticks on the fire, and hastened back through
the cleft towards the spring. Around the baobab
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
she came upon Winthrope, working in the shade
of the great tree. The three leopard skins had
been stretched upon bamboo frames, and he was
resignedly scraping at their inner surfaces with a
smooth-edged stone. Miss Leslie did not look too
closely at the operation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is&#8211;he?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Winthrope motioned down the cleft.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope he hasn&#8217;t gone far. I&#8217;m half famished.
Aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Miss Genevieve, it is odd, you know.
Not an hour since, the very thought of food&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now you&#8217;re as hungry as I am. Oh, I
do wish he had not gone off just at the wrong
time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He went to take a dip in the sea. You know,
he got so messed up over the nastiest part of the
work, which I positively refused to do&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that beyond the bamboos?&#8211;There&#8217;s
something alive!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray, don&#8217;t be alarmed. It is&#8211;er&#8211;it&#8217;s all
right, Miss Genevieve, I assure you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what is it? Such queer noises, and I
see something alive!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only the vultures, if you must know. Nothing
else, I assure you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all out of sight from the spring. You are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
not to go around the bamboos until the&#8211;that is,
not to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Mr. Blake say that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes&#8211;to be sure. He also said to tell
you that the cutlets were on the top shelf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean &#8211;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His way of ordering you to cook our dinner.
Really, Miss Genevieve, I should be pleased to
take your place, but I have been told to keep to
this. It is hard to take orders from a low fellow,&#8211;very hard for a gentleman, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie gazed at her shapely hands. Three
days since she could not have conceived of their
being so rough and scratched and dirty. Yet
her disgust at their condition was not entirely
unqualified.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least I have something to show for them,&#8221;
she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg pardon,&#8221; said Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just look at my hands&#8211;like a servant&#8217;s!
And yet I am not nearly so ashamed of them as
I would have fancied. It is very amusing, but
do you know, I actually feel proud that I have
done something&#8211;something useful, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Useful?&#8211;I call it shocking, Miss Genevieve.
It is simply vile that people of our breeding
should be compelled to do such menial work.
They write no end of romances about castaways;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
but I fail to see the romance in scraping skins
Indian fashion, as this fellow Blake calls it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose, though, we should remember how
much Mr. Blake is doing for us, and should try
to make the best of the situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has no best. It is all a beastly muddle,&#8221;
complained Winthrope, and he resumed his nervous
scraping at the big leopard skin.</p>

<p>The girl studied his face for a moment, and
turned away. She had been trying so hard to
forget.</p>

<p>He heard her leave, and called after, without
looking up: &#8220;Please remember. He said to
cook some meat.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not answer. Having satisfied her
thirst at the spring, she took one of the bamboo
rods, with its haggled blackening pieces of flesh,
and returned to the fire. After some little experimenting,
she contrived a way to support the
rod beside the fire so that all the meat would
roast without burning.</p>

<p>At first, keen as was her hunger, she turned
with disgust from the flabby sun-seared flesh;
but as it began to roast, the odor restored her
appetite to full vigor. Her mouth fairly watered.
It seemed as though Winthrope and Blake would
never come. She heard their voices, and took
the bamboo spit from the fire for the meat to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
cool. Still they failed to appear, and unable to
wait longer, she began to eat. The cub meat
proved far more tender than that of the old
leopard. She had helped herself to the second
piece before the two men appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on, Miss Jenny; fair play!&#8221; sang out
Blake. &#8220;You&#8217;ve set to without tooting the
dinner-horn. I don&#8217;t blame you, though. That
smells mighty good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both men caught at the hot meat with eagerness,
and Winthrope promptly forgot all else in
the animal pleasure of satisfying his hunger.
Blake, though no less hungry, only waited to fill
his mouth before investigating the condition of
the prospective tree ladder. The result of the
attempt to burn the trunk did not seem encouraging
to the others, and Miss Leslie looked away,
that her face might not betray her, should he
have an inkling of her neglect. She was relieved
by the cheerfulness of his tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Slow work, this fire business&#8211;eh? Guess,
though, it&#8217;ll go faster this afternoon. The green
wood is killed and is getting dried out. Anyway,
we&#8217;ve got to keep at it till the tree goes
over. This spring leopard won&#8217;t last long at the
present rate of consumption, and we&#8217;ll need the
eggs to keep us going till we get the hang of our
bows.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>&#8220;What is that smoke back there?&#8221; interrupted
Miss Leslie. &#8220;Can it be that the fire down the
cleft has sprung up again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; it&#8217;s your fumigation. You had plenty
of brush on hand, so I heaved it into the hole,
and touched it off. While it&#8217;s burning out, you
can put in time gathering grass and leaves for a
bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you and Mr. Winthrope mind breaking
off some bamboos for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie colored and hesitated. &#8220;I&#8211;I
should like to divide off a corner of the place
with a wall or screen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope tried to catch Blake&#8217;s eye; but the
American was gazing at Miss Leslie&#8217;s embarrassed
face with a puzzled look. Her meaning
dawned upon him, and he hastened to reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Miss Jenny. You can build your
wall to suit yourself. But there&#8217;ll be no hurry
over it. Until the rains begin, Win and I&#8217;ll sleep
out in the open. We&#8217;ll have to take turn about
on watch at night, anyway. If we don&#8217;t keep
up a fire, some other spotted kitty will be sure to
come nosing up the gully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There must also be lions in the vicinity,&#8221;
added Winthrope.</p>

<p>Miss Leslie said nothing until after the last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
pieces of meat had been handed around, and
Blake sprang up to resume work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Blake,&#8221; she called, in a low tone; &#8220;one
moment, please. Would it save much bother if
a door was made, and you and Mr. Winthrope
should sleep inside?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see about that later,&#8221; replied Blake,
carelessly.</p>

<p>The girl bit her lip, and the tears started to her
eyes. Even Winthrope had started off without
expressing his appreciation. Yet he at least
should have realized how much it had cost her
to make such an offer.</p>

<p>By evening she had her tree-cave&#8211;house, she
preferred to name it to herself&#8211;in a habitable
condition. When the purifying fire had burnt
itself out, leaving the place free from all odors
other than the wholesome smell of wood smoke,
she had asked Blake how she could rake out the
ashes. His advice was to wet them down where
they lay.</p>

<p>This was easier said than done. Fortunately,
the spring was only a few yards distant, and after
many trips, with her palm-leaf hat for bowl, the
girl carried enough water to sprinkle all the
powdery ashes. Over them she strewed the leaves
and grass which she had gathered while the fire
was burning. The driest of the grass, arranged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
in a far corner, promised a more comfortable bed
than had been her lot for the last three nights.</p>

<p>During this work she had been careful not to
forget the fire at the tree. Yet when, near sundown,
she called the others to the third meal of
leopard meat, Blake grumbled at the tree for
being what he termed such a confounded tough
proposition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good thing there&#8217;s lots of wood here, Win,&#8221;
he added. &#8220;We&#8217;ll keep this fire going till the
blamed thing topples over, if it takes a year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you surely will not stay so far from
the baobab to-night!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold hard!&#8221; soothed Blake. &#8220;You&#8217;ve no
license to get the jumps yet a while. We&#8217;ll have
another fire by the baobab. So you needn&#8217;t
worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes later they went back to the
baobab, and Winthrope began helping Miss Leslie
to construct a bamboo screen in the narrow entrance
of the tree-cave, while Blake built the
second fire.</p>

<p>As Winthrope was unable to tell time by the
stars, Blake took the first watch. At sunset,
following the engineer&#8217;s advice, Winthrope lay
down with his feet to the small watch-fire, and
was asleep before twilight had deepened into
night. Fagged out by the mental and bodily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
stress of the day, he slept so soundly that it
seemed to him he had hardly lost consciousness
when he was roused by a rough hand on his
forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he mumbled.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout one o&#8217;clock,&#8221; said Blake. &#8220;Wake up!
I ran overtime, &#8217;cause the morning watch is the
toughest. But I can&#8217;t keep &#8217;wake any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, this is a beastly bore,&#8221; remarked
Winthrope, sitting up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Um-m,&#8221; grunted Blake, who was already on
his back.</p>

<p>Winthrope rubbed his eyes, rose wearily, and
drew a blazing stick from the fire. With this upraised
as a torch, he peered around into the darkness,
and advanced towards the spring.</p>

<p>When, having satisfied his thirst, he returned
somewhat hurriedly to the fire, he was startled by
the sight of a pale face gazing at him from between
the leaves of the bamboo screen.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Miss Genevieve, what is the matter?&#8221;
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush! Is he asleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like a top.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank Heaven! . . . . Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night&#8211;er&#8211;I say, Miss Genevieve&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the girl disappeared, and Winthrope, after
a glance at Blake&#8217;s placid face, hurried along the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
cleft to stack the other fire. When he returned
he noticed two bamboo rods which Blake had begun
to shape into bow staves. He looked them
over, with a sneer at Blake&#8217;s seemingly unskilful
workmanship; but he made no attempt to finish
the bows.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>A DESPOILED WARDROBE</span></h2>

<p>Soon after sunrise Miss Leslie was awakened
by the snap and dull crash of a falling
tree. She made a hasty toilet, and ran out
around the baobab. The burned tree, eaten half
through by the fire, had been pushed over against
the cliff by Blake and Winthrope. Both had
already climbed up, and now stood on the edge
of the cliff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Miss Jenny!&#8221; shouted Blake. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
got here at last. Want to come up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now, thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy enough. But you&#8217;re right. Try
your hand again at the cutlets, won&#8217;t you? While
they&#8217;re frying, we&#8217;ll get some eggs for dessert
How does that strike you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no way to cook them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Roast &#8217;em in the ashes. So long!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie cooked breakfast over the watch-fire,
for the other had been scattered and stamped
out by the men when the tree fell. They came
back in good time, walking carefully, that they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
might not break the eggs with which their pockets
bulged. Between them, they had brought a round
dozen and a half. Blake promptly began stowing
all in the hot ashes, while Winthrope related
their little adventure with unwonted enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should have come with us, Miss Genevieve,&#8221;
he began. &#8220;This time of day it is
glorious on the cliff top. Though the rock is
bare, there is a fine view&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine view of grub near the end,&#8221; interpolated
Blake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes; the birds&#8211;you must take a look
at them, Miss Genevieve! The sea end of the
cliff is alive with them&#8211;hundreds and thousands,
all huddled together and fighting for room. They
are a sight, I assure you! They&#8217;re plucky, too.
It was well we took sticks with us. As it was,
one of the gannets&#8211;boobies, Blake calls them&#8211;caught
me a nasty nip when I went to lift her off
the nest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Best way is to kick them off,&#8221; explained
Blake. &#8220;But the point is that we&#8217;ve hopped
over the starvation stile. Understand? The
whole blessed cliff end is an omelette waiting for
our pan. Pass the leopardettes, Miss Jenny.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the last bit of meat had disappeared,
Blake raked the eggs from the ashes, and began
to crack them, solemnly sniffing at each before he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
laid it on its leaf platter. Some were a trifle
&#8220;high.&#8221; None, however, were thrown away.</p>

<p>When it was all over, Winthrope contemplated
the scattered shells with a satisfied air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;this is the first
time I have felt&#8211;er&#8211;replenished since we
found those cocoanuts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about one of &#8217;em now to top off on?&#8221;
questioned Blake.</p>

<p>Miss Leslie sighed. &#8220;Why did you speak of
them! I am still hungry enough to eat more
eggs&#8211;a dozen&#8211;that is, if we had a little salt
and butter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a silver cup and napkins!&#8221; added Blake.
&#8220;About the salt, though, we&#8217;ll have to get some
before long, and some kind of vegetable food.
It won&#8217;t do to keep up this whole meat menu.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If only those little bamboo sprouts were as
good as they look&#8211;like a kind of asparagus!&#8221;
murmured Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that the Chinese eat them,&#8221; said
Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;They eat rats, too,&#8221; commented Blake.</p>

<p>&#8220;We might at least try them,&#8221; persisted Miss
Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;How? Raw?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard papa tell of roasting corn when
he was a boy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s so; and roasting-ears are better than
boiled. Win, I guess we&#8217;ll have a sample of
bamboo asparagus <i> la</i> Les-lee!&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope took the penknife, and fetched a
handful of young sprouts from the bamboo
thicket. They were heated over the coals on a
grill of green branches, and devoured half raw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; mumbled Blake, as he ruminated on
the last shoot, &#8220;we&#8217;re getting on some for this
smell hole of a coast: house and chicken ranch,
and vegetables in our front yard&#8211; We&#8217;ve got
old Bobbie Crusoe beat, hands down, on the
start-off, and he with his shipful of stuff for
handicap!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you believe that the situation looks
more hopeful, Mr. Blake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve at least got an extension on our
note for a week or two. But I&#8217;m not going to
coddle you with a lot of lies, Miss Jenny.
There&#8217;s the fever coming, sure as fate. I may
stave it off a while; you and Win, ten to one,
will be down in a few days&#8211;and not a smell
of quinine in our commissary. Then there&#8217;ll be
dysentery and snakes and wild beasts&#8211;No;
we&#8217;re not out of the woods yet, not by a&#8211;considerable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, Blake,&#8221; muttered Winthrope, &#8220;I
must say, you&#8217;re not very encouraging.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t say I was trying to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Blake, I am sure papa will offer a
large reward when the steamer is reported as lost.
There will be ships searching for us&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not in the British Channel, and I&#8217;ll
bet what few boats do coast along here don&#8217;t nose
about much among these coral reefs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy it would do no harm to erect a signal,&#8221;
said Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only thing that would make a show is Miss
Leslie&#8217;s skirt,&#8221; replied Blake.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the big leopard skin,&#8221; persisted
Winthrope. To his surprise the engineer took
the suggestion under serious consideration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If we had
a water background, now. But against the rock
and trees,&#8211;no; what we want is white. I&#8217;ll tell
you&#8211;when Miss Jenny sets to and makes herself
a dress of that skin, I&#8217;ll fly her skirt to the
zephyrs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Blake! I really think that is cruel of
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come now; that&#8217;s not fair! I wouldn&#8217;t
have said a word, but you said you wanted to
help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, Mr. Blake. I&#8211;I did not
quite understand you. I really do want to help&#8211;to do my share&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re talking! You see, it&#8217;s not only
a question of the signal, but of clothes. We&#8217;ve
got to figure anyway on needing new ones before
long. Look at my pants and vest, and Win&#8217;s too.
Inside a month we&#8217;ll all be in hide&#8211;or in hiding.
That&#8217;s a joke, Win, me b&#8217;y; see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But in the meantime&#8211;&#8221; began Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the meantime we&#8217;re like to miss a chance
or two of being picked up, just because we&#8217;ve
failed to stick out a signal that&#8217;d catch the eye
twice as far off as any other color than scarlet.
Do you suppose I worked my way up from axeman
to engineer, and didn&#8217;t learn anything about
flags?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is all really too absurd! I do not know
the first thing about sewing, and I have neither
thread nor needle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s up to you, though, if you want to help.
My sisters sewed mighty soon after they learned
to toddle. &#8217;Bout time you learned&#8211; There,
now; I didn&#8217;t mean to hurt your feelings. You&#8217;ve
made a fair stagger at cooking, and I bet you win
out on the dressmaking. For needle you can use
one of these long slim thorns&#8211;poke a hole, and
then slip the thread through, like a shoemaker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes; but the thread?&#8221; put in Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cocoanut fibre would hardly do,&#8221; said
Miss Leslie, forgetting to dry her eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>&#8220;No. We could get fairly good fibres out
of the palm leaves; but catgut will be a whole
lot better. I&#8217;ll slit up a lot for you, fine
enough to sew with. And now, let&#8217;s get down
to tacks. No offence&#8211;but did either of you
ever learn to do anything useful in all your
blessed little lives?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Blake, of course I&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course what?&#8221; demanded Blake, as Miss
Leslie hesitated. &#8220;We know all about your
cooking and sewing. What else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I see what you meant. I fear that nothing
of what I learned would be of service now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boarding-school rot, eh? And you, Winthrope?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you would kindly name over what you
have in mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um!&#8221; grunted Blake. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s first of all
a question of a practical&#8211;practical, mind you,&#8211;knowledge of metallurgy, ceramics, and how
to stick an arrow through a beef roast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;ah&#8211;I believe I intimated that I have
some knowledge of archery. But I doubt&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut it out! You&#8217;ll have enough else to do.
Get busy over those bows and arrows, and don&#8217;t
quit till you&#8217;ve got them in shape. Leave my
bow good and stiff. I can pull like a mule can
kick. Well, Miss Jenny; what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>&#8220;Is not&#8211;has not ceramics something to do
with burning china?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8211;china, pottery, and all that. Know
anything about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I have a friend who amuses herself by
painting china, and I know it has to be burned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s all!&#8221; grunted Blake. &#8220;Well, let
me tell you. When I was a little kid I used to
work in a pottery. All I can remember is that
they&#8217;d take clay, shape it into a pot, dry it, and
bake the thing in a kiln. We&#8217;ve got to work the
same game somehow. This kind of eating will
mean dysentery in short order. So there&#8217;s going
to be a bean-pot for our stews, or Tom Blake&#8217;ll
know the reason why. Nurse up that ankle of
yours, Win. We&#8217;ll trek it to-morrow&#8211;cocoanuts,
and maybe something else. There&#8217;s clay
on the far bank of the river, and across from it I
saw a streak that looked like brown hmatite.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST</span></h2>

<p>The next four days slipped by almost unheeded.
Blake saw to it that not only
himself but his companions had work to
occupy every hour of daylight. When not engaged
in cooking and fuel gathering, Miss Leslie
was learning by painful experience the rudiments
of dressmaking.</p>

<p>At the start she had all but ruined the beautiful
skin of the mother leopard before Blake chanced
to see her and took over the task of cutting it
into shape for a skirt. But when it came to
making a waist of the cub fur, he said that she
would have to puzzle out the pattern from her
other one. Between cooking three meals a day
over an open fire, gathering several armfuls of
wood, and making a dress with penknife, thorn,
and catgut, the girl had little time to think of
other matters than her work.</p>

<p>Winthrope had been gazetted as hunter in
ordinary. His task was to keep Miss Leslie supplied
with fresh eggs and each day to kill as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
many of the boobies and cormorants as he could
skin and split for drying. Blake had changed
his mind about taking him when he went for
cocoanuts. Instead, he had gone alone on several
trips, bringing three or four loads of nuts,
then a little salt from the seashore, dirty but very
welcome, and last of all a great lump of clay,
wrapped in palm fronds.</p>

<p>With this clay he at once began experiments
in the art of pottery. Having mixed and beaten
a small quantity, he moulded it into little cups
and bowls, and tried burning them over night in
the watch-fire. A few came out without crack or
flaw. Vastly elated by this success, he fashioned
larger vessels from his clay, and within the week
could brag of two pots suitable for cooking stews,
and four large nondescript pieces which he called
plates. What was more, all had a fairly good
sand glaze, for he had been quick to observe a
glaze on the bottoms of the first pots, and had
reasoned out that it was due to the sand which
had adhered while they stood drying in the sun.</p>

<p>He next turned his attention to metallurgy.
The first move was to search the river bank for
the brown bog iron ore which he believed he
had seen from the farther side. After a dangerous
and exhausting day&#8217;s work in the mire and
jungle, he came back with nothing more to show
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
for his pains than an armful of creepers. Late
in the afternoon, he had located the hmatite,
only to find it lying in a streak so thin that he
could not hope to collect enough for practical
purposes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky we&#8217;ve got something to fall back on,&#8221;
he added, after telling of his failure. &#8220;Pass over
those keys of yours, Win. Good! Now untangle
those creepers. To-night we&#8217;ll take turns
knotting them up into some sort of a rope-ladder.
I&#8217;m getting mighty weary of hoofing it all
around the point every time I trot to the river.
After this I&#8217;ll go down the cliff at that end of
the gully.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope, who had become very irritable and
depressed during the last two days, turned on
his heel, with the look of a fretful child.</p>

<p>To cover this undiplomatic rudeness, Miss
Leslie spoke somewhat hurriedly. &#8220;But why
should you return again to the river, Mr. Blake?
I&#8217;m sure you are risking the fever; and there
must be savage beasts in the jungle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my business,&#8221; growled Blake. He
paused a moment, and added, rather less ungraciously,
&#8220;Well, if you care, it&#8217;s this way&#8211;I&#8217;m
going to keep on looking for ore. Give me
a little iron ore, and we&#8217;ll mighty soon have a
lot of steel knives and arrow-heads that&#8217;ll amount
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
to something. How&#8217;re we going to bag anything
worth while with bamboo tips on our arrows?
Those boar tusks are a fizzle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you will continue to risk your life for us?
I think that is very brave and generous, Mr.
Blake!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; demanded Blake, not a little
puzzled. He was fully conscious of the risk; but
this was the first intimation he had received or
conceived that his motives were other than selfish&#8211;&#8220;Um-m!
So that&#8217;s the ticket. Getting
generous, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not getting&#8211;you <i>are</i> generous! When I
think of all you have done for us! Had it not
been for you, I am sure we should have died
that first day ashore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t blame me. I couldn&#8217;t have let
a dog die that way; and then, a fellow needs a
Man Friday for this sort of thing. As for you, I
haven&#8217;t always had the luck to be favored with
ladies&#8217; company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Blake. I quite appreciate
the compliment. But now, I must put on supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake followed her graceful movements with an
intentness which, in turn, drew Winthrope&#8217;s attention
to himself. The Englishman smiled in a disagreeable
manner, and resumed his work on the
bows, with the look of one mentally preoccupied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
After supper he found occasion to spend some
little time among the bamboos.</p>

<p>When at sunset Miss Leslie withdrew into the
baobab, Winthrope somewhat officiously insisted
upon helping her set up her screen in the entrance.
As he did so, he took the opportunity to
hand her a bamboo knife, and to draw her attention
to several double-pointed bamboo stakes
which he had hidden under the litter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked, troubled by his furtive
glance back at Blake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Merely precaution, you know,&#8221; he whispered.
&#8220;The ground in there is quite soft. It will be
no trouble, I fancy, to put up the stakes, with
their points inclined towards the entrance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so loud, Miss Genevieve! It struck
me that if any one should seek to enter in the
night, he would find these stakes deucedly unpleasant.
Be careful how you handle them. As
you see, the sharper points, which are to be
set uppermost, run off into a razor edge. Put
them up now, before it grows too dark. You
know how ninepins are set&#8211;that shape. Good-night!
You see, with these to guard the entrance,
you need not be afraid to go to sleep
at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she whispered, and began to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
thrust the stakes into the ground as he had
directed.</p>

<p>He had not been mistaken. The vague doubts
and fears which she already entertained would
have kept her awake throughout the night, but
thanks to the sense of security afforded by the
sword-bayonets of her silent little sentries, the
girl was soon able to calm herself, and was fast
asleep long before Blake wakened Winthrope.</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast, Blake&#8211;who had
spent his watch in grinding the edges from a stone
and experimenting with split and bent twigs&#8211;put Winthrope&#8217;s keys in the fire, and began
an attempt to shape them into a knife-blade.
To heat the steel to the required temperature,
he used a bamboo blowpipe, with his lungs for
bellows.</p>

<p>Winthrope turned away with an indifferent
bearing; but Miss Leslie found herself compelled
to stop and admire his dexterous use of his rude
tools.</p>

<p>One after another, the keys were welded together,
end to end, in a narrow ribbon of steel.
The thinnest one, however, was not fastened to
the tip until it had been used to burn a groove in
the edge of a rib, selected from among the bones
which Miss Leslie had thrown out of the baobab.
The last key was then fastened to the others;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
the blade ground sharp, tempered, and inserted
in the groove. Finally, pieces of the key-ring
were fitted in bands around the bone, through
notches cut in the ends of the steel blade. The
result was a bone-handled, bone-backed knife,
with a narrow cutting edge of fine steel.</p>

<p>Long before it was finished Miss Leslie had
been forced away by the requirements of her
own work. In fact, Blake did not complete his
task until late in the afternoon. At the end, he
spent more than an hour grinding the handle into
shape. When he came to show the completed
knife to Miss Leslie, he was fairly aglow with
justifiable pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that for an Eskimo job?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;Bunch of keys and a bone, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are certainly very ingenious, Mr. Blake!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nixy! There&#8217;s little of the inventor in my
top piece&#8211;only some hustle and a good memory.
I was up in Alaska, you know. Saw a sight of
Eskimo work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, it is very skilfully done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be&#8211;Look out for the edge!
It&#8217;d do to shave. No more bamboo splinters for
me&#8211;dull when you hit a piece of bone. I&#8217;m
ready now to skin a rhinoceros.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can catch one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess we could find enough of them around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
here, all right. But we&#8217;ll start in on some of
Win&#8217;s sheep and cattle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do! One grows tired of eggs, and all
these sea-birds are so tough and fishy, no matter
how I cook them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll sneak down to the pool, and make a
try with the bows this evening. I&#8217;ll give odds,
though, that we draw a blank. Win&#8217;s got the
aim, but no drive; I&#8217;ve got the drive, but no aim.
Even if I hit an antelope, I don&#8217;t think a bamboo-pointed
arrow would bother him much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t the savages kill game without iron
weapons?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure; but a lot have flint points, and a lot of
others use poison. I know that the Apaches and
some of those other Southern Indians used to fix
their arrows with rattlesnake poison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How horrible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that depends on how you look at it. I
guess they thought guns more horrible when
they tackled the whites and got the daylight
let through &#8217;em. At any rate, they swapped
arrows for rifles mighty quick, and any one
who knows Apaches will tell you it wasn&#8217;t
because they thought bullets would do less damage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet the thought of poison&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but the thought of self-preservation!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
Sooner than starve, I&#8217;d poison every animal in
Africa&#8211;and so would you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I&#8211;You put it in such a horrible way.
One must consider others, animals as well as
people; and yet&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Survival of the fittest. I&#8217;ve read some things,
and I&#8217;m no fool, if I do say it myself. For instance,
I&#8217;m the boss here, because I&#8217;m the fittest
of our crowd in this environment; but back in
what&#8217;s called civilized parts, where the law lets
a few shrewd fellows monopolize the means of
production, a man like your father&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Blake, it is not my fault if papa&#8217;s position
in the business world&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor his, either&#8211;it&#8217;s the cussed system!
No; that&#8217;s all right, Miss Jenny. I was only illustrating.
Now, I take it, both you and Win
would like to get rid of a boss like me, if you
could get rid of Africa at the same time. As it
is, though, I guess you&#8217;d rather have me for
boss, and live, than be left all by your lonesomes,
to starve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I&#8217;m sure there is no question of your
leadership, Mr. Blake. We have both tried our
best to do what you have asked of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> have, at least. But I know. If a ship
should come to-morrow, it&#8217;d be Blake to the
back seat. &#8216;Papa, give this&#8211;er&#8211;person a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
check for his services, while I chase off with
Winnie, to get my look-in on &#8217;Is Ri-yal &#8217;Igh-ness.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie flushed crimson&#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;m sure,
Mr. Blake&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t let that worry you, Miss Jenny.
It don&#8217;t me. I couldn&#8217;t be sore with you if I
tried. Just the same, I know what it&#8217;ll be like.
I&#8217;ve rubbed elbows enough with snobs and big
bugs to know what kind of consideration they
give one of the mahsses&#8211;unless one of the
mahsses has the drop on them. Hello, Win!
What&#8217;s kept you so late?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None of your business!&#8221; snapped Winthrope.</p>

<p>Miss Leslie glanced at him, even more puzzled
and startled by this outbreak than she had been
by Blake&#8217;s strange talk. But if Blake was
angered, he did not show it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Win,&#8221; he remarked gravely, &#8220;I was
going to take you down to the pool after supper,
on a try with the bows. But I guess you&#8217;d
better stay close by the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; it is time you gave a little consideration
to those who deserve it,&#8221; rejoined Winthrope,
with a peevishness of tone and manner which
surprised Miss Leslie. &#8220;I tell you, I&#8217;m tired
of being treated like a dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, all right, old man. Just draw up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
your chair, and get all the hot broth aboard you
can stow,&#8221; answered Blake, soothingly.</p>

<p>Winthrope sat down; but throughout the meal,
he continued to complain over trifles with the
peevishness of a spoiled child, until Miss Leslie
blushed for him. Greatly to her astonishment,
Blake endured the nagging without a sign of
irritation, and in the end took his bow and
arrows and went off down the cleft, with no more
than a quiet reminder to Winthrope that he should
keep near the fire.</p>

<p>When, shortly after dark, the engineer came
groping his way back up the gorge, he was by
no means so calm. Out of six shots, he had hit
one antelope in the neck and another in the
haunch; yet both animals had made off all the
swifter for their wounds.</p>

<p>The noise of his approach awakened Winthrope,
who turned over, and began to complain in a
whining falsetto. Miss Leslie, who was peering
out through the bars of her screen, looked to see
Blake kick the prostrate man. His frown showed
only too clearly that he was in a savage temper.
To her astonishment, he spoke in a soothing tone
until Winthrope again fell asleep. Then he
quietly set about erecting a canopy of bamboos
over the sleeper.</p>

<p>Just why he should build this was a puzzle to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
the girl. But when she caught a glimpse of
Blake&#8217;s altered expression, she drew a deep
breath of relief, and picked her way around the
edge of her bamboo stakes, to lie down without a
trace of the fear which had been haunting her.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE MARK OF THE BEAST</span></h2>

<p>Morning found Winthrope more irritable
and peevish than ever. Though
he had not been called on watch by
Blake until long after midnight, he had soon
fallen asleep at his post and permitted the fire to
die out. Shortly before dawn, Blake was roused
by a pack of jackals, snarling and quarrelling
over the half-dried seafowl. To charge upon the
thieves and put them to flight with a few blows
of his club took but a moment. Yet daylight
showed more than half the drying frames empty.</p>

<p>Blake was staring glumly at them, with his
broad back to Winthrope, when Miss Leslie
appeared. The sudden cessation of Winthrope&#8217;s
complaints brought his companion around on the
instant. The girl stood before him, clad from
neck to foot in her leopard-skin dress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be&#8211;dashed!&#8221; he exclaimed, and
he stood staring at her open-mouthed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear it will be warm. Do you think it becoming?&#8221;
she asked, flushing, and turning as
though to show the fit of the costume.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>&#8220;Do I?&#8221; he echoed. &#8220;Miss Jenny, you&#8217;re a
peach!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And here is the
skirt. I have ripped it open. You see, it will
make a fine flag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s put up. Seems a pity, though, to do
that, when we&#8217;re getting on so fine. What do
you say to leaving it down, and starting a little
colony of our own?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie raised the skirt in her outstretched
hands. Behind it her face became white as the
cloth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; demanded Blake soberly, though his
eyes were twinkling.</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget the fever,&#8221; she retorted mockingly,
and Blake failed to catch the quaver beneath
the light remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, you&#8217;ve got me there!&#8221; he admitted.
&#8220;Just pass over your flag, and scrape up some
grub. I&#8217;ll be breaking out a big bamboo. There
are plenty of holes and loose stones on the cliff.
We&#8217;ll have the signal up before noon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie murmured her thanks, and immediately
set about the preparation of breakfast.</p>

<p>When Blake had the bamboo ready, with one
edge of the broad piece of white duck lashed to it
with catgut as high up as the tapering staff would
bear, he called upon Winthrope to accompany him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>&#8220;You can go, too, Miss Jenny,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;You haven&#8217;t been on the cliff yet, and you
ought to celebrate the occasion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; replied the girl. &#8220;I&#8217;m still
unprepared to climb precipices, even though my
costume is that of a savage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Savage? Great Scott! that leopard dress
would win out against any set of Russian furs
a-going, and I&#8217;ve heard they&#8217;re considered all
kinds of dog. Come on. I can swing you into
the branches, and it&#8217;s easy from there up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will excuse me, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you can go alone,&#8221; interposed Winthrope.
&#8220;I am indisposed this morning, and,
what is more, I have had enough of your
dictation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have, have you?&#8221; growled Blake, his
patience suddenly come to an end. &#8220;Well, let
me tell you, Miss Leslie is a lady, and if she
don&#8217;t want to go, that settles it. But as for you,
you&#8217;ll go, if I have to kick you every step.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope cringed back, and broke into a
childish whine. &#8220;Don&#8217;t&#8211;don&#8217;t do it, Blake&#8211;Oh,
I say, Miss Genevieve, how can you stand
by and see him abuse me like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake was grinning as he turned to Miss Leslie.
Her face was flushed and downcast with humiliation
for her friend. It seemed incredible that a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
man of his breeding should betray such weakness.
A quick change came over Blake&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;I guess I&#8217;m
enough of a sport to know something about fair
play. Win&#8217;s coming down with the fever, and&#8217;s
no more to blame for doing the baby act than
he&#8217;ll be when he gets the delirium, and gabbles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will thank you to attend to your own
affairs,&#8221; said Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re entirely welcome. It&#8217;s what I&#8217;m
doing.&#8211; Do you understand, Miss Jenny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, yes; and I wish to thank you. I
have noticed how patient you have been&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, Miss Leslie,&#8221; rasped Winthrope.
&#8220;Can you not see that for a fellow of this class
to talk of fair play and patience is the height of
impertinence? In England, now, such insufferable
impudence&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do,&#8221; broke in Blake. &#8220;It&#8217;s time for
us to trot along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Blake, if he is ill&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the reason why he should keep moving.
No more of your gab, Win! Give your jaw a
lay-off, and try wiggling your legs instead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope turned away, crimson with indignation.
Blake paused only for a parting word with
Miss Leslie. &#8220;If you want something to do, Miss
Jenny, try making yourself a pair of moccasins
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
out of the scraps of skin. You can&#8217;t stay in this
gully all the time. You&#8217;ve got to tramp around
some, and those slippers must be about done for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are still serviceable. Yet if you
think&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll need good tough moccasins soon
enough. Singe off the hair, and make soles of
the thicker pieces. If you do a fair job, maybe
I&#8217;ll employ you as my cobbler, soon as I get the
hide off one of those skittish antelope.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie nodded and smiled in response to
his jesting tone. But as he swung away after
Winthrope, she stood for some time wondering at
herself. A few days since she knew she would
have taken Blake&#8217;s remark as an insult. Now
she was puzzled to find herself rather pleased
that he should so note her ability to be of
service.</p>

<p>When she roused herself, and began singeing
the hair from the odds and ends of leopard skin,
she discovered a new sensation to add to her list
of unpleasant experiences. But she did not pause
until the last patch of hair crisped close to the
half-cured surface of the hide. Fetching the penknife
and her thorn and catgut from the baobab,
she gathered the pieces of skin together, and
walked along the cleft to the ladder-tree. There
had been time enough for Blake and Winthrope
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
to set up the signal, and she was curious to see
how it looked.</p>

<p>She paused at the foot of the tree, and gazed up
to where the withered crown lay crushed against
the edge of the cliff. The height of the rocky
wall made her hesitate; yet the men, in passing
up and down, had so cleared away the twigs and
leaves and broken the branches on the upper side
of the trunk, that it offered a means of ascent far
from difficult even for a young lady.</p>

<p>The one difficulty was to reach the lower
branches. She could hardly touch them with her
finger-tips. But her barbaric costume must have
inspired her. She listened for a moment, and
hearing no sound to indicate the return of the
men, clasped the upper side of the trunk with her
hands and knees, and made an energetic attempt
to climb. The posture was far from dignified,
but the girl&#8217;s eyes sparkled with satisfaction as
she found herself slowly mounting.</p>

<p>When, flushed and breathless, she gained a
foothold among the branches, she looked down at
the ground, and permitted herself a merry little
giggle such as she had not indulged in since leaving
boarding-school. She had actually climbed
a tree! She would show Mr. Blake that she was
not so helpless as he fancied.</p>

<p>At the thought, she clambered on up, finding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
that the branches made convenient steps. She
did not look back, and the screen of tree-tops
beneath saved her from any sense of giddiness.
As her head came above the level of the cliff, she
peered through the foliage, and saw the signal-flag
far over near the end of the headland. The
big piece of white duck stood out bravely against
the blue sky, all the more conspicuous for the
flocks of frightened seafowl which wheeled above
and around it.</p>

<p>Surprised that she did not see the men, Miss
Leslie started to draw herself up over the cliff
edge. She heard Winthrope&#8217;s voice a few yards
away on her left. A sudden realization that the
Englishman might consider her exploit ill-bred
caused her to sink back out of sight.</p>

<p>She was hesitating whether to descend or to
climb on up, when Winthrope&#8217;s peevish whine
was cut short by a loud and angry retort from
Blake. Every word came to the girl&#8217;s ears with
the force of a blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do, do you? Well, I&#8217;d like to know
where in hell you come in. She&#8217;s not your
sister, nor your mother, nor your aunt, and if
she&#8217;s your sweetheart, you&#8217;ve both been damned
close-mouthed over it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an irritable, rasping murmur from
Winthrope, and again came Blake&#8217;s loud retort.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>&#8220;Look here, young man, don&#8217;t you forget you
called me a cad once before. I can stand a good
deal from a sick man; but I&#8217;ll give it to you
straight, you&#8217;d better cut that out. Call me a
brute or a savage, if that&#8217;ll let off your steam;
but, understand, I&#8217;m none of your English
kinds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Winthrope spoke, this time in a fretful
whine.</p>

<p>Blake replied with less anger: &#8220;That&#8217;s so;
and I&#8217;m going to show you that I&#8217;m the real
thing when it comes to being a sport. Give you
my word, I&#8217;ll make no move till you&#8217;re through
the fever and on your legs again. What I&#8217;ll do
then depends on my own sweet will, and don&#8217;t
you forget it. I&#8217;m not after her fortune. It&#8217;s
the lady herself that takes my fancy. Remember
what I said to you when you called me a cad
the other time. You had your turn aboard ship.
Now I can do as I please; and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m
going to do, if I have to kick you over the cliff
end first, to shut off your pesky interference.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl crouched back into the withered
foliage, dazed with terror. Again she heard Blake
speak. He had dropped into a bitter sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;No chance? It&#8217;s no nerve, you mean. You
could brain me, easy enough, any night&#8211;just
walk up with a club when I&#8217;m asleep. Trouble
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
is, you&#8217;re like most other under dogs&#8211;&#8217;fraid
that if you licked your boss, there&#8217;d be no soup
bones. So I guess I&#8217;m slated to stay boss of this
colony&#8211;grand Poo Bah and Mikado, all in one.
Understand? You mind your own business, and
don&#8217;t go to interfering with me any more! . . . .
Now, if you&#8217;ve stared enough at the lady&#8217;s
skirt&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>The threat of discovery stung the girl to instant
action. With almost frantic haste, she scrambled
down to the lower branches, and sprang to the
ground. She had never ventured such a leap
even in childhood. She struck lightly but without
proper balance, and pitched over sideways.
Her hands chanced to alight upon the remnants
of leopard skin. Great as was her fear, she
stopped to gather all together in the edge of
her skirt before darting up the cleft.</p>

<p>At the baobab she turned and gazed back along
the cliff edge. Before she had time to draw a
second breath, she caught a glimpse of Blake&#8217;s
palm-leaf hat, near the crown of the ladder tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;O-o-h!&#8211;he didn&#8217;t see me!&#8221; she murmured.
Her frantic strength vanished, and a deathly
sickness came upon her. She felt herself going,
and sought to kneel to ease the fall.</p>

<p>She was roused from the swoon by Blake&#8217;s
resonant shout: &#8220;Hey, Miss Jenny! where are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
you? We&#8217;ve got your laundry on the pole in
fine shape!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s flaccid limbs grew tense, and her
body quivered with a shudder of dread and loathing.
Yet she set her little white teeth, and forced
herself to rise and go out to face the men. Both
met her look with a blank stare of consternation.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Miss Genevieve?&#8221; cried Winthrope.
&#8220;You&#8217;re white as chalk!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the fever!&#8221; growled Blake. &#8220;She&#8217;s in
the cold stage. Get a pot on. We&#8217;ll&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; it&#8217;s not that! It&#8217;s only&#8211;I&#8217;ve
been frightened!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Frightened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By a&#8211;a dreadful beast!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beast!&#8221; repeated Blake, and his pale eyes
flashed as he sprang across to where his bow and
arrows and his club leaned against the baobab.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have no beasts nosing around my dooryard!
Must be that skulking lion I heard last
night. I&#8217;ll show him!&#8221; He caught up his
weapons and stalked off down the cleft.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; exclaimed Winthrope; &#8220;the man
really must be mad. Call him back, Miss Genevieve.
If anything should happen to him&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If only there might!&#8221; gasped the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>She burst into a hysterical laugh. &#8220;Oh! oh!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
it&#8217;s such a joke&#8211;such a joke! At least he&#8217;s
not a hyena&#8211;oh, no; a brave beast! Hear
him shout! And he actually thinks it&#8217;s a lion!
But it isn&#8217;t&#8211;it&#8217;s himself! Oh, dear! oh, dear!
what shall I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Genevieve, what do you mean? Be
calm, pray, be calm!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Calm!&#8211;when I heard what he said? Yes;
I heard every word! In the top of the tree&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the tree? Heavens! Miss&#8211;er&#8211;Miss
Genevieve!&#8221; stammered Winthrope, his face
paling. &#8220;Did you&#8211;did you hear all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything&#8211;everything he said! What
shall I do? I am so frightened! What shall
I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything <i>he</i> said?&#8221; echoed Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;You spoke too low for me to hear; but I&#8217;m
sure you faced him like a gentleman&#8211;I must
believe it of you&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope drew in a deep breath. &#8220;Ah, yes;
I did, Miss Genevieve&#8211;I assure you. The beast!
Yet you see the plight I am in. It is a nasty
muddle&#8211;indeed it is! But what can I do?
He is strong as a gorilla. Really, there is only
one way&#8211;no doubt you heard him taunt me
over it. I assure you I should not be afraid&#8211;but it would be so horrid&#8211;so cold-blooded. As
a gentleman, you know&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>&#8220;No; it is not that!&#8221; broke in the girl. &#8220;He
is right. Neither of us has the courage&#8211;even
when he is asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Miss Genevieve, this beast instinct
to kill&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but think of him. If he is a beast, he
is at least a brave one. While we&#8211;we haven&#8217;t
the courage of rabbits. I thought you called
yourself an English gentleman. Are you going
to stand by, and not lift a finger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, now, Miss Genevieve, to murder a
man&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Self-defence is not a crime&#8211;self-preservation.
If you have a spark of manhood&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake, if you can&#8217;t do anything,
at least keep still! Oh, I&#8217;m sure I shall go mad!
If only I had been drowned!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, to be sure. But really now, what
you ask is a good deal for a man to risk. The
fellow might wake up and murder me! Should
I take the risk, might I&#8211;er&#8211;expect some manifestation
of your gratitude, Miss Genevieve?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course! of course! I should always&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;ah&#8211;refer to the&#8211;the&#8211;bestowal of
your hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My hand? I&#8211; Would you bargain for
my esteem? I thought you a gentleman!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>&#8220;To be sure&#8211;to be sure! Who says I am
not? But all is fair in love and war, you know.
Your choice is quite free. I take it, you will not
consider his&#8211;er&#8211;proposals. But if you do
not wish my aid, you have another way of
escape&#8211;that is&#8211;at least other women have
done it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl gazed at him, her eyes dilating with
horror as she realized his meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; not that!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;I want to
live&#8211;I&#8217;ve a right to live! Why, I&#8217;m only just
twenty-two&#8211;I&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; cautioned Winthrope. &#8220;He&#8217;s coming
back. Be calm! There will be time until I
get over this vile malaria. It may be that he
himself will have the fever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will not have the fever,&#8221; replied the girl,
in a hopeless tone, and she leaned back listlessly
against the baobab, as Blake swung himself up,
frowning and sullen, and flung his weapons from
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; he grumbled, &#8220;I told you that brute
was a sneak. I&#8217;ve chased clean down to the
pool and into the open, and not a smell of him.
Must have hiked off into the tall grass the minute
he heard me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If only he had gone off for good!&#8221; murmured
Miss Leslie.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>&#8220;Maybe he has; though you never can count
on a sneak. Even you might be able to shoo
him off next time; but, like as not, he&#8217;d come
along when we were all out calling, and clean
out our commissary. Guess I&#8217;ll set to and run
up a barricade down there where the gully is
narrowest. There&#8217;re shoals of dead thorn-brush
to the right of the pool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes; I fancy the vultures will be so
vexed when they find your hedge in the way,&#8221;
remarked Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;My! how smart we&#8217;re getting!&#8221; retorted
Blake. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, though. We&#8217;ll stow the
stuff in Miss Jenny&#8217;s boudoir, and I guess the
birdies&#8217;ll be polite enough to keep out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must say, Blake, I do not see why you
should wish to drag us away from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;re lots of things you don&#8217;t see,
Win, me b&#8217;y&#8211;jokes, for instance. But what
could you expect?&#8211;you&#8217;re English. Now,
don&#8217;t get mad. Worst thing in the world for
malaria.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One would fancy you could see that I am not
angry. I&#8217;ve a splitting headache, and my back
hurts. I am ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake looked him over critically, and nodded.
&#8220;That&#8217;s no lie, old man. You&#8217;re entitled to a
hospital check all right. Miss Jenny, we&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
appoint you chief nurse. Make him comfortable
as you can, and give him hot broth whenever he&#8217;ll
take it. You can do your sewing on the side.
Whenever you need help, call on me. I&#8217;m going
to begin that barricade.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>FEVER AND FIRE AND FEAR</span></h2>

<p>By nightfall Winthrope was tossing and
groaning on the bed of leaves which Miss
Leslie had heaped beneath his canopy.
Though not delirious, his high temperature, coupled
with the pains which racked every nerve and
bone in his body, rendered him light-headed. He
would catch himself up in the midst of some
rambling nonsense to inquire anxiously whether
he had said anything silly or strange. On being
reassured upon this, he would relax again, and, as
likely as not, break into a babyish wail over his
aches and pains.</p>

<p>Blake shook his head when he learned that
the attack had not been preceded by a chill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess he&#8217;s in for a hot time,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;There is more&#8217;n one kind of malarial fever.
Some are a whole lot like typhus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Typhus? What is that?&#8221; asked Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sort of rapid fire, double action typhoid. Not
that I think Win&#8217;s got it&#8211;only malaria. What
gets me is that we&#8217;ve only been here these few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
days, and yet it looks like he&#8217;s got the continuous,
no-chill kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you think he will be very ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess he&#8217;ll think so. It ought to run
out in a week or ten days, though. We&#8217;ve had
good water, and it usually takes time for malaria
to soak in deep. Now, don&#8217;t worry, Miss Jenny.
It&#8217;ll do him no good, and you a lot of harm.
Take things easy as you can, for you&#8217;ve got to
keep up your strength. If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll be
down yourself before Win is up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ill while he is helpless and unable&#8211;? Oh,
no; that cannot be! I must not give way to the
fever until&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. You&#8217;ll likely stave it off for
a couple of weeks or so. You&#8217;re lively yet, and
that&#8217;s a good sign. I knew Win was in for it
when he began to grouch and loaf and do the
baby act. I haven&#8217;t much use for dudes in general,
and English dudes in particular; but I&#8217;ll
admit that, while Win&#8217;s soft enough in spots,
he&#8217;s not all mush and milk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Blake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome. I couldn&#8217;t say less, seeing
that Win can&#8217;t speak for himself. Now you
tumble in and get a good sleep. I&#8217;ll go on as
night nurse, and work at the barricade same time.
You&#8217;re not going to do any night-nursing. I can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
gather the thorn-brush in the afternoons, and pile
it up at night.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the morning Miss Leslie found that Blake
had built a substantial canopy over the invalid,
in place of the first ramshackle structure.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s best for him to be out in the air,&#8221; he explained;
&#8220;so I fixed this up to keep off the dew.
But whenever it rains, we&#8217;ll have to tote him
inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes; to be sure. How is he?&#8221; murmured
the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s about the same this morning. But he
got a little sleep. Keep him dosed with all the
hot broth he&#8217;ll take. And say, roust me out at
noon. I&#8217;ve had my breakfast. Now I&#8217;ll have a
snooze. So long!&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded, and crawled under the shade of
the nearest bush, too drowsy to observe her look
of dismay.</p>

<p>At noon, having learned that Winthrope&#8217;s condition
showed little change, Blake ate a hearty
meal, and at once set off down the cleft. He did
not reappear until nightfall; though at intervals
Miss Leslie had heard his step as he came up the
ravine with his loads of thorn-brush.</p>

<p>This course of action became the routine for the
following ten days. It was broken only by three
incidents, all relating to the important matter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
of food supply. Winthrope had soon tired of
broth, and showed such an insatiable craving for
cocoanut milk that the stock on hand had become
exhausted within the week.</p>

<p>The day after, Blake took the rope ladder, as
he called the tangle of knotted creepers, and went
off towards the north end of the cleft. When he
returned, a little before dark, the lower part of
his trousers was torn to shreds, and the palms of
his hands were blistered and raw; but he carried
a heavy load of cocoanuts. After a vain attempt
to climb the giant palms on the far side of the
river, he had found another grove near at hand,
in the little plain, and had succeeded in reaching
the tops of two of the smaller palms.</p>

<p>Under his directions, Miss Leslie clarified a
bowl of bird fat&#8211;goose-grease, Blake called it,&#8211;and dressed his hands. Yet even with the
bandages which she made of soft inner bark and
the handkerchiefs, he was unable to handle the
thorn-brush the following day. Unfortunately
for him, he was not content to sit idle. During
the night he had cut a bamboo fishing-pole and
lengthened Miss Leslie&#8217;s line of plaited cocoanut-fibre
with a long catgut leader. In the afternoon
he completed his outfit with a hairpin hook and a
piece of half-dried meat.</p>

<p>He was back an hour earlier than usual, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
brought with him a dozen or more fair-sized fish.
His mouth was watering over the prospective
feast, and Miss Leslie showed herself hardly less
eager for a change from their monotonous diet.
As the fish were already dressed, she raked up
the coals and quickly contrived a grill of green
bamboos.</p>

<p>When the odor of the broiling fish spread about
in the still air, even Winthrope sniffed and turned
over, while Blake watched the crisping delicacies
with a ravenous look. Unable to restrain himself,
he caught up the smallest fish, half cooked,
and bolted it down with such haste that he burnt
his mouth. He ran over to the spring for a
drink, and Winthrope cackled derisively.</p>

<p>Miss Leslie was too absorbed in her cooking to
observe the result of Blake&#8217;s greediness. She
had turned the fish for the last time, and was
about to lift them off the fire, when Blake came
running back, and sent grill and all flying with a
violent kick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Salt!&#8221; he gasped&#8211;&#8220;where&#8217;s the salt? I&#8217;m
poisoned!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poisoned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poison fish! Don&#8217;t eat! God!&#8211;Where&#8217;s
the salt?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl stared at him. His agony was so
great that beads of sweat were rolling down his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
face. He writhed, and stretched out a quivering
hand&#8211;&#8220;Salt, quick!&#8211;warm water&#8211;salt!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s none left! You remember,
yesterday&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; groaned Blake, and for a moment he
sank down, overcome by a racking convulsion.
Then his jaw closed like a bulldog&#8217;s, and gritting
his teeth with the effort, he staggered up and
rushed off down the cleft.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! stop, Mr. Blake! Where are you
going?&#8221; screamed the girl.</p>

<p>She started to run after him, but was halted by
an outburst of delirious laughter. Winthrope
was sitting upright and waving his fever-blotched
hands&#8211;&#8220;Hi, hi! look at &#8217;im run! &#8217;E&#8217;s got
w&#8217;at&#8217;ll do for &#8217;im! Run, you swine; you&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>There followed a torrent of cockney abuse so
foul that Miss Leslie blushed scarlet with shame
as she sought to quiet him. But the excitement
had so heightened his fever that he was in a
raving delirium. It was close upon midnight
before his temperature fell, and he sank into a
death-like torpor. In her ignorance, she supposed
that he had fallen asleep.</p>

<p>Her relief was short-lived, for soon she remembered
Blake. She could see him lying beside the
pool or out on the bare plain, his resolute eyes
cold and glassy, his powerful body contorted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
in the death agony. The vision filled her with
dismay. With all his coarseness, the man had
showed himself so resourceful, so indomitable,
that when she sought to dwell upon her reasons
to fear him, she found herself admiring his virile
manliness. He might be a brute, but he did not
belong among the jackals and hyenas. Indeed, as
she called to mind his strong face and frank, blunt
speech she all but disbelieved what her own ears
had heard.</p>

<p>And anyway, without his aid, what should she
do? Winthrope had already become as weak as
a child. The emaciation of his jaundiced features
was a mockery of their former plumpness. Blake
had said that the fever might run on for another
week, and that even if Winthrope recovered, he
would probably be helpless for several days
besides.</p>

<p>What was no less serious, though she had
concealed the fact from Blake, she herself had
been troubled the past week with the depression
and lassitude which had preceded Winthrope&#8217;s
attack. If Blake was dead, and she should fall
ill before Winthrope recovered, they would both
die from lack of care. And if they did not die
of the fever, what of their future, here on this
desolate savage coast!</p>

<p>But the very keenness of her mental anguish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
so exhausted and numbed the girl&#8217;s brain that
she at last fell into a heavy sleep. The fire
burned low, and shadowy forms began to creep
from behind the bamboos and the trees and rocks
down the gorge. There was no sound; but
greedy, wolfish eyes gleamed in the starlight.</p>

<p>Only the day before Blake had told Miss
Leslie to store the last rack of cured meat inside
the baobab. The two sleepers lay between
the fire and the entrance to the hollow. Slowly
the embers of the fire died away into gray ashes,
and slowly the night prowlers drew nearer. The
boldest of the pack crept close to Miss Leslie,
and, with teeth bared and back bristling, sniffed
at the edge of her skirt. Whether because of her
heavy breathing or the odor of the leopard skin,
the beast drew away, with an uneasy whine.</p>

<p>There was a pause; then, backed by three
others, the leader approached Winthrope. He
was still lying in the death-like torpor, and he
lacked the protection which, in all likelihood, the
leopard skin had given Miss Leslie. The cowardly
brutes took him for dead or dying. They
sniffed at him from head to foot, and then, with
a ferocious outburst of snarls and yells, flung
themselves upon him.</p>

<p>Had it not chanced that Winthrope was lying
upon his side, with one arm thrown up, he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
have been fatally wounded by the first slashing
bites of his assailants. The two which sought
to tear him were baffled by the thick folds of
Blake&#8217;s coat, while their leader&#8217;s slash at the
victim&#8217;s throat was barred by the upraised arm.
With a savage snap, the beast&#8217;s jaws closed
on the arm, biting through to the bone. At the
same instant the fourth jackal tore ravenously
at one of the outstretched legs.</p>

<p>With a shriek of agony, Winthrope started
up from his torpor, and struck out frantically
in a fury of pain and terror. Startled by the
violence of this unexpected resistance, the jackals
leaped back&#8211;only to spring in again as
the remainder of the pack made a rush to forestall
them.</p>

<p>Winthrope was staggering to his feet, when
the foremost brute leaped upon him. He fell
heavily against one of the main supports of his
bamboo canopy, and the entire structure came
down with a crash. Two of the jackals, caught
beneath the roof, howled with fear as they sought
to free themselves. The others, with brute dread
of an unknown danger, drew away, snarling and
gnashing their teeth.</p>

<p>Wakened by the first ferocious yelps of Winthrope&#8217;s
assailants, Miss Leslie had started up and
stared about in the darkness. On all sides she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
could see pairs of fiery eyes and dim forms like
the phantom creatures of a nightmare. Winthrope&#8217;s
shriek, instead of spurring her to action,
only confused her the more and benumbed her
faculties. She thought it was his death cry, and
stood trembling, transfixed with horror.</p>

<p>Then came the fall of the canopy. His cries
as he sought to throw it off showed that he was
still alive. In a flash her bewilderment vanished.
The stagnant blood surged again through her
arteries in a fiery, stimulating torrent. With a
cry, to which primeval instinct lent a menacing
note, she groped her way to the fallen canopy,
and stooped to lift up one side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8211;into the tree!&#8221; she called.</p>

<p>Still frantic with terror, Winthrope struggled
to his feet. She thrust him towards the baobab,
and followed, dragging the mass of interwoven
bamboos. Emboldened by the retreat of their
quarry, the snarling pack instantly began to close
in. Fortunately they were too cowardly to rush
at once, and fear spurred their intended victims
to the utmost haste. Groping and stumbling, the
two felt their way to the baobab, and Miss Leslie
pushed Winthrope headlong through the entrance.
As he fell, she turned to face the pack.</p>

<p>The foremost beasts were at the rear edge of
the bamboo framework, their eyes close to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
ground. Instinct told her that they were crouching
to leap. With desperate strength she caught
up the canopy before her like a great shield, and
drew it in after her until the ends of the cross-bars
were wedged fast against the sides of the opening.
Though it seemed so firm, she clung to it with a
convulsive grasp as she felt the pack leaders fling
themselves against the outer side.</p>

<p>But Blake had lashed the bamboos securely
together, and none of the beasts was heavy
enough to snap the supple bars. Finding that
they could not break down the barrier, they
began to scratch and tear at the thatch which
covered the frame. Soon a pair of lean jaws
thrust in and snapped at the girl&#8217;s skirt. She
sprang back, with a cry: &#8220;Help! Quick, Mr.
Winthrope! They&#8217;re breaking through!&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope made no response. She stooped,
and found him lying inert where he had fallen.
She had only herself to depend upon. A screen
of sharp sticks which she had made for the entrance
was leaning against the inner wall, within
easy reach. To grasp it and thrust it against the
other framework was the work of an instant.</p>

<p>Still she trembled, for the eager beasts had
ripped the thatch from the canopy, and their inthrust
jaws made short work of the few leaves
on her screen. Unaware that even a lion or a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
tiger is quickly discouraged by the knife-like
splinters of broken bamboo, she expected every
moment that the jackals would bite their way
through her frail barrier.</p>

<p>She remembered the stakes given her by Winthrope,
hidden under the leaves and grass of her
bed. She groped her way across the hollow,
and uncovered one of the stakes. In her haste
she cut her hand on its razor-like edge. All unheeding,
she sprang back towards the entrance.
She was none too soon. One of the smaller
jackals had forced its head and one leg between
the bars, and was struggling to enlarge the
opening.</p>

<p>Fearful that the whole pack was about to burst
in upon her, the girl grasped the bamboo stake in
both hands, and began stabbing and lunging at the
beast with all her strength. The jackal squirmed
and snarled and snapped viciously. But the girl
was now frantic. She pressed nearer, and though
the white teeth grazed her wrist, she drove home
a thrust that changed the beast&#8217;s snarls into a howl
of pain. Before she could strike again, it had
struggled back out of the hole, beyond reach.</p>

<p>Tense and panting with excitement, she leaned
forward, ready to stab at the next beast. None
appeared, and presently she became aware that the
pack had been daunted by the experience of their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
unlucky fellow. Their snarls and yells had subsided
to whines, which seemed to be coming from a
greater distance. Still she waited, with the bamboo
stake upraised ready to strike, every nerve
and muscle of her body tense with the strain.</p>

<p>So great was the stress of her fear and excitement
that she had not heeded the first gray
lessening of the night. But now the glorious
tropical dawn came streaming out of the east
in all its red effulgence. Above and through the
bamboo barrier glowed a light such as might have
come from a great fire on the cliff top. Still
tense and immovable, the girl stared out up the
cleft. There was not a jackal in sight. She
leaned forward and peered around, unable to believe
such good fortune. But the night prowlers
had slunk off in the first gray dawn.</p>

<p>The girl drew in a deep, shuddering sigh, and
sank back. Her hand struck against Winthrope&#8217;s
foot. She turned about quickly and looked at
him. He was lying upon his face. She hastened
to turn him upon his side, and to feel his forehead.
It was cool and moist. He was fast asleep
and drenched with sweat. The great shock of his
pain and fear and excitement had broken his fever.</p>

<p>With the relief and joy of this discovery, the
girl completely relaxed. Not observing Winthrope&#8217;s
wounds, which had bled little, she sought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
to force a way out through the entrance. It was
by no means an easy task to free the wedged
framework, and when, after much pulling and
pushing, she at last tore the mass loose, she
found herself perspiring no less freely than
Winthrope.</p>

<p>She was far too preoccupied, however, to consider
what this might mean. Her first thought
was of the fire. She ran to her rude stone fireplace
and raked over the ashes. They were still
warm, but there was not a live ember among
them. Yet she realized that Winthrope must
have hot food when he wakened, and Blake had
carried with him the magnifying glass. For a
little she stood hesitating. But the defeat of the
jackals had given her courage and resolution such
as she had never before known. She returned
into the cave, and chose the sharpest of her
stakes. Having made certain that Winthrope was
still asleep, she set off boldly down the cleft.</p>

<p>At the first turn she came upon Blake&#8217;s thorn
barricade. It stretched across the narrowest part
of the cleft in an impenetrable wall, twelve feet
high. Only in the centre was a gap, which could
have been filled by Blake in less than two hours&#8217;
work. The girl&#8217;s eyes brightened. She herself
could gather the thorn-brush and fill the gap before
night. They no longer need fear the jackals
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
or even the larger beasts of prey. None the less,
they must have fire.</p>

<p>Spurred on by the thought, she was about to
spring through the barricade when she heard the
tread of feet on the path beyond. She crouched
down, and peered through the tangle of brush in
the edge of the gap. Less than ten paces away
Blake was plodding heavily up the trail. She
stepped out before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8211;you! Are you alive?&#8221; she gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Live? You bet your boots!&#8221; came back the
grim response. &#8220;You bet I&#8217;m alive&#8211;though
I had to go Jonah one better to do it. The whale
heaved him up; I heaved up the whale&#8211;and it
took about a barrel of sea-water to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sea-water?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure . . . . I tumbled over twice on the way.
But I made the beach. Lord! how I pumped in
the briny deep! Guess I won&#8217;t go into details&#8211;but
if you think you know anything about seasickness&#8211;
<i>Whew!</i> Lucky for yours truly, the
tide was just starting out, and the wind off shore.
I&#8217;d fallen in the water, and the Jonah business
laid me out cold. Didn&#8217;t know anything until
the tide came up again and soused me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very glad you&#8217;re not dead. But how
you must have suffered! You are still white, and
your face is all creased.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>Blake attempted a careless laugh. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry
about me. I&#8217;m here, O. K., all that&#8217;s left,&#8211;a
little wobbly on my pins, but hungry as a shark.
But say, what&#8217;s up with you? You&#8217;re sweating
like a&#8211; Good thing, though. It&#8217;ll stave off
your spell of fever a while. How &#8217;d you happen
to be coming down here so early?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was starting to find you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not you&#8211;that is, I thought you were dead.
I was going to make certain, and to&#8211;to get the
burning-glass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um-m. I see. Let the fire go out, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not blame me, Mr. Blake! I was so ill
and worn out, and I&#8217;ve paid for it twice over,
really I have. Didn&#8217;t those awful beasts attack
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beasts? How&#8217;s that?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you must have heard them! The
horrid things tried to kill us!&#8221; she cried, and she
poured out a half incoherent account of all that
had happened since he left.</p>

<p>Blake listened intently, his jaw thrust out, his
eyes glowing upon her with a look which she had
never before seen in any man&#8217;s eyes. But his first
comment had nothing to do with her conduct.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8211;sorry Win got rousted out of
his nice little snooze&#8211; Snooze! Why, don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
you know, we&#8217;d been all alone in our glory by
to-night if it hadn&#8217;t been for those brutes. He
was in the stupor, and that would have been the
end of him if the beasts hadn&#8217;t stirred him up
so lively. I&#8217;ve heard of such a thing before, but
I always thought it was a fake. Here you are
sweating, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel much better than yesterday. I did not
tell you, but I have felt ill for nearly a week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Fraid to tell, eh?&#8211;and you were so scared
over the beasts&#8211; Scared! By Jiminy, you&#8217;ve
got grit, little woman! There&#8217;s two kinds of
scaredness; you&#8217;ve got the Stonewall Jackson
kind. If anybody asks you, just refer them to
Tommy Blake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Blake. But should we not
hasten back now to prepare something for Mr.
Winthrope?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ditto for yours truly. I&#8217;m like that sepulchre
you read about&#8211;white outside, and within
nothing but bare bones and emptiness.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>WITH BOW AND CLUB</span></h2>

<p>The fire was soon re-lit, and a pot of meat
set on to stew. It had ample time to
simmer. Winthrope was wrapped in a
life-giving sleep, out of which he did not waken
until evening, while Blake, unable to wait for
the pot to boil, and nauseated by the fishy odor
of the dried seafowl, hunted out the jerked leopard
meat, and having devoured enough to satisfy
a native, fell asleep under a bush.</p>

<p>The sun was half down the sky when he sat
up and looked around, wide awake the moment
he opened his eyes. Miss Leslie was quietly
placing an armful of sticks on the fuel heap
beside the baobab.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Miss Jenny! Hard at it, I see,&#8221; he
called cheerfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; she cautioned. &#8220;Mr. Winthrope is
still asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good thing for him. He&#8217;ll need all of that
he can get.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you think&#8211;?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>&#8220;Well, between you and me, I don&#8217;t believe
Win was built for the tropics. This fever of his,
coming on so soon, wouldn&#8217;t have hit nine men
in ten half so hard. He&#8217;s bound to have another
spell in a month or two, and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But cannot we possibly get away from here
before then? Is there no way? Surely, you
are so resourceful&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing, Miss Jenny! Give me tools,
and I&#8217;d engage to turn out a seagoing boat. But
as it is, the only thing I could do would be to
fire-burn a log. That would take two or three
months, and in the end we&#8217;d have a lop-sided
canoe that&#8217;d live about half a second in one of
these tropic squalls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not the natives sail in canoes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe they do&#8211;and they make fire by
rubbing sticks. We don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what can we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take our medicine, and wait for a ship to
show up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we have no medicine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have no&#8211; Say, Miss Jenny, you really
ought to have stayed home from boarding-school
and England long enough to learn your own
language. I meant, we&#8217;ve got to take what&#8217;s
coming to us, without laying down or grouching.
Both are the worst thing out for malaria.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>&#8220;You mean that we must resign ourselves to
this intolerable situation&#8211;that we must calmly
sit here and wait until the fever&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I&#8217;ll take care we don&#8217;t sit around very
much. We&#8217;ll go on the hike, soon as Win can
wobble. Which reminds me, I&#8217;ve got a little
hike on hand now. I&#8217;m going to close up that
barricade before dark. Me for a quiet night!&#8221;</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, he took his weapons,
and swung briskly away down the cleft.</p>

<p>He returned a few minutes before sunset, with
what appeared to be a large fur bag upon his back.
Miss Leslie was pouring a bowl of broth from the
stew-pot, and did not notice him until he sang
out to her: &#8220;Hey, Miss Jenny, spill over that
stuff! No more of that in ours!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s for Mr. Winthrope. He has just wakened,&#8221;
she replied, still intent on her pouring.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;d kill him with that slop! Heave
it over. He&#8217;s going to have beef juice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! what&#8217;s that on your back? You&#8217;ve
killed an antelope!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure! Bushbuck, I guess they call him.
Sneaked up when he was drinking, and stuck an
arrow into his side. He jumped off a little way,
and turned to see what&#8217;d bit him. I hauled off
and put the second arrow right through his eye,
into his brain. Neatest thing you ever saw.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>&#8220;You surely are becoming a splendid archer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; Jim dandy! I could do it again about
once in ten thousand shots. All the same, I&#8217;ve
raked in this peacherino. Trot out your grill
and we&#8217;ll have something fit to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You spoke of beef juice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a dozen steaks ready to broil. Slap &#8217;em
on the fire, and I&#8217;ll squeeze out enough juice
with my fist to do Win for to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made good his assertion, using several of
the steaks, which, having lost less than half their
juices in the process, were eaten with great relish
by Miss Leslie and himself.</p>

<p>Winthrope, after drinking the stimulating beef
juice and a quantity of hot water, turned over
and fell asleep again while Blake was dressing
his wounds. None of these was serious of itself;
but Blake knew the danger of infection in the
tropics, and carefully washed out the gashes
before applying the tallow salve which Miss
Leslie had tried out from the antelope fat.</p>

<p>The dressing was completed by torchlight.
Blake then rolled the sleeper into a comfortable
position, took the torch from Miss Leslie, and
left the cave, pausing at the entrance to mutter
a gruff good-night. The girl murmured a response,
but watched him anxiously as he passed
out. A step beyond the entrance he paused and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
turned again. In the red glare of the torch, his
face took on an expression that filled her with
fright. Shrouded by the gloom of the hollow,
she drew back to her bed, and without turning
her eyes away from him, groped for one of her
bamboo stakes.</p>

<p>But before she could arm herself, she saw Blake
stoop over and grasp with his free hand the mass
of interwoven bamboos. He straightened himself,
and the framework swung lightly up and over,
until it stood on end across the cave entrance.
The girl stole around and peered out at him. He
had spread open the antelope skin, and was beginning
to slice the meat for drying. Though his
forehead was furrowed, his expression was by
no means sinister. Relieved at the thought that
the light must have deceived her, she returned to
her bed and was soon sleeping as soundly as
Winthrope.</p>

<p>Blake strung the greater part of the meat on
the drying racks, built a smudge fire beneath, and
stretched the antelope skin on a frame. This
done, he took his club and a small piece of bloody meat,
and walked stealthily down the cleft to the
barricade. Quiet as was his approach, it was met
by a warning yelp on the farther side of the
thorny wall, and he could hear the scurry of
fleeing animals.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>He kept on until the barricade loomed up before
him in the starlight. From cliff to cliff the
wall now stretched across the gorge without hole
or gap. But Blake grasped the trunk of a young
date-palm which projected from the barricade
near the bottom, and pushed it out. The displacement
of the spiky fronds disclosed the low
passage which he had made in the centre of the
barricade. He placed the piece of meat on one
side, two or three feet from the hole, and squatted
down across from it, with his club balanced on
his shoulder.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed&#8211;an hour; and still he
waited, silent and motionless as a statue. At last
stealthy footsteps sounded on the outer side of
the thorn wall, and an animal began to creep
through the wall, sniffing for the bait. Blake
waited with the immobility of an Eskimo. The
delay was brief.</p>

<p>With a boldness for which Blake had not been
prepared, the beast leaped through and seized the
meat. Even in the dim light, Blake could see
that he had lured an animal larger than any
jackal. But this only served to lend greater force
to his blow. As he struck, he leaped to his feet
The brute fell as though struck by lightning
and lay still.</p>

<p>Blake prodded the inert form warily; then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
knelt and passed his hands over it. The beast
had whirled about just in time to meet the descending
club, and the blow had crushed in its
skull. Chuckling at the success of his ruse, he
drew the palm back into the opening, and swung
his prize over his shoulder. When he came to
the fire, a glance showed him that he had killed
a full-grown spotted hyena.</p>

<p>In the morning, when Miss Leslie appeared,
there were two hides stretched on bamboo frames,
and the air was dark with vultures streaming
down into the cleft near the barricade. Blake
was sleeping the sleep of the just, and did not
waken until she had built the fire and begun to
broil the steaks which he had saved.</p>

<p>Again they had a feast of the fresh antelope
meat. But with repletion came more of fastidiousness,
and Blake agreed with Miss Leslie when she
remarked that salt would have added to the flavor.
He set off presently, and spent half a day on the
talus of the headland, gathering salt from the rock
crannies.</p>

<p>For the next three days he left the cleft only
to gather eggs. The greater part of his time was
spent in tanning the hyena and antelope skins.
Meantime Miss Leslie continued to nurse Winthrope
and to gather firewood. Under Blake&#8217;s
directions, she also purified the salt by dissolving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
it in a pot of water, and allowing the dirt to settle,
when the clarified solution was poured off and
evaporated over the fire in one of the earthenware
pans.</p>

<p>At first Winthrope had been too weak to sit
up. But treated to a liberal diet of antelope
broth, raw eggs, hot water, and cocoanut milk, he
gained strength faster than Blake had expected.
On the fourth day Blake set him to work on the
final rubbing of the new skins; on the fifth, he
ordered him to go for eggs.</p>

<p>Much to Miss Leslie&#8217;s surprise, Winthrope
started off without a word of protest. All his
peevish irritability and childishness had gone with
the fever, and the girl was gratified to see the
quiet manner in which he set about a task which
seemed an imposition upon his half-regained
strength. But the very motive which, seemingly,
prevented him from protesting, impelled her to
speak for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Blake!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;Mr. Winthrope
is going off without a word; but I can&#8217;t endure
it! You have no right to send him on such an
errand. It will kill him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake met her indignant look with a sober stare.</p>

<p>&#8220;What if it does!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Better for him
to die in the gallant service of his fellows, than to
sit here and rot. Eh, Win?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>&#8220;Do not trouble yourself, Miss Genevieve. I
hope I shall pull through all right. If not&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you shall not! I&#8217;ll go myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Miss Leslie,&#8221; said Blake, somewhat
sternly; &#8220;who&#8217;s got the responsibility of keeping
you two alive for the next month or so? I&#8217;ve
been in the tropics before, and I know something
of the way people have to live to get out again.
I&#8217;m trying to do my best, and I tell you straight,
if you won&#8217;t mind me, I&#8217;m going to make you,
no matter how much it hurts your feelings. You
see how nice and meek Win takes his orders. I
explained matters to him last night&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I assure you, Blake, you shall have no cause
for complaint as to my conduct,&#8221; muttered Winthrope.
&#8220;I should like to observe, however, that
in speaking to Miss Leslie&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There you are again, with your everlasting
talk. Cut it out, and get busy. To-morrow we
all go on a hike to the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Winthrope started off, Blake turned to Miss
Leslie, with a good-natured grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, it&#8217;s this way, Miss Jenny&#8211;&#8221; he
began. He caught her look of disdain, and his
face darkened. &#8220;Mad, eh? So that&#8217;s the
racket!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Blake, I will not have you talk to me in
that way. Mr. Winthrope is a gentleman, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
nothing more to me than a friend such as any
young woman&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That settles it! I&#8217;ll take your word for it,
Miss Jenny,&#8221; broke in Blake, and springing up,
he set about his work, whistling.</p>

<p>The girl gazed at his broad back and erect head,
uncertain whether she should feel relieved or
anxious. The more she thought the matter over,
the more uncertain she became, and the more she
wondered at her uncertainty. Could it be possible
that she was becoming interested in a man who,
if her ears had not deceived her&#8211; But no! That
could not be possible!</p>

<p>Yet what a ring there was to his voice!&#8211;so
clear and tonic after Winthrope&#8217;s precise, modulated
drawl. And her countryman&#8217;s firmness!
He could be rude if need be; but he would make
her do what he thought was best for her health.
Was it not possible that she had misunderstood
his words on the cliff, and so misjudged&#8211;wronged&#8211;him?&#8211;that Winthrope, so eager to stipulate for
her hand&#8211; But then Winthrope had more than
confirmed her dreadful conclusions taken from
Blake&#8217;s words, and Winthrope was an English
gentleman. It could not be possible that an
English gentleman&#8211;</p>

<p>She ended in a state of utter bewilderment.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SAVAGE MANIFEST</span></h2>

<p>As Winthrope had succeeded in dragging himself
to and from the headland without a
collapse, the following morning, as soon as
the dew was dry, Blake called out all hands for the
expedition. He was in the best of humors, and
showed unexpected consideration by presenting
Winthrope with a cane, which he had cut and
trimmed during the night.</p>

<p>Having sent Miss Leslie to fill the whiskey flask
with spring water, he dropped three cocoanut-shell
bowls, a piece of meat and a lump of salt
into one of the earthenware pots, and slung all
over his shoulder in the antelope skin. With his
bow hung over the other shoulder, knife and arrows
in his belt, and his big club in hand, he
looked ready for any contingency.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll hit first for the mouth of the river,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going on ahead. If I&#8217;m not in
sight when you come up, pick a tree where the
ground is dry, and wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I say, Blake,&#8221; replied Winthrope, &#8220;I see
animals over in the coppices, and you should
know that I am physically unable&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>&#8220;Nothing but antelope,&#8221; interrupted Blake.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen them enough now to know them twice
as far off. And you can bet on it they&#8217;d not
be there if any dangerous beast was in smelling
distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is so clever of you, Mr. Blake,&#8221; remarked
Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Simple enough when you happen to think
of it,&#8221; responded Blake. &#8220;Yes; the only thing
you&#8217;ve got to look out for&#8217;s the ticks in the grass.
They&#8217;ll keep you interested. They bit me up in
great shape.&#8221;</p>

<p>He scowled at the recollection, nodded by
way of emphasis, and was off like a shot. The
edge of the plain beneath the cliff was strewn
with rocks, among which, even with Miss Leslie&#8217;s
help, Winthrope could pick his way but slowly.
Before they were clear of the rough ground, they
saw Blake disappear among the mangroves.</p>

<p>The ticks proved less annoying than they had
apprehended after Blake&#8217;s warning. But when
they approached the mouth of the river, they
were alarmed to hear, above the roar of the surf,
loud snorting, such as could only be made by
large animals. Fearful lest Blake had roused and
angered some forest beast, they veered to the
right, and ran to hide behind a clump of thorns.
Winthrope sank down exhausted the moment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
they reached cover; but Miss Leslie crept to the
far end of the thicket and peered around.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, look here!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;It&#8217;s a whole
herd of elephants trying to cross the river mouth
where we did, and they&#8217;re being drowned, poor
things!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Elephants?&#8221; panted Winthrope, and he
dragged himself forward beside her. &#8220;Why, so
there are; quite a drove of the beasts. Yet, I
must say, they appear smaller&#8211;ah, yes; see
their heads. They must be the hippos Blake
saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those ugly creatures? I once saw some at
the zoo. Just the same, they will be drowned.
Some are right in the surf!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say, I&#8217;m sure, Miss Genevieve, but I
have an idea that the beasts are quite at home in
the water. I fancy they enjoy surf bathing as
keenly as ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do believe you are right. There is one
going in from the quiet water. But look at
those funny little ones on the backs of the
others!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must be the baby hippos,&#8221; replied Winthrope,
indifferently. &#8220;If you please, I&#8217;ll take a pull at
the flask. I am very dry.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he had half emptied the flask, he
stretched out in the shade to doze. But Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
Leslie continued to watch the movements of the
snorting hippos, amused by the ponderous antics
of the grown ones in the surf, and the comic
appearance of the barrel-like infants as they
mounted the backs of their obese mothers.</p>

<p>Presently Blake came out from among the
mangroves, and walked across to the beach, a
few yards away from the huge bathers. To all
appearances, they paid as little attention to him
as he to them. Miss Leslie glanced about at
Winthrope. He was fast asleep. She waited
a few moments to see if the hippopotami would
attack Blake. They continued to ignore him,
and gaining courage from their indifference, she
stepped out from behind the thicket, and advanced
to where Blake was crouched on the
beach. When she came up, she saw beside him
a heap of oysters, which he was opening in rapid
succession.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! You&#8217;re just in time to help,&#8221; he
called. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Win!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Asleep behind those bushes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Worst thing he could do. But lend a hand, and
we&#8217;ll shuck these oysters before rousting him out.
You can rinse those I&#8217;ve opened. Fill the pot
with water, and put them in to soak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They look very tempting. How did you
chance to find them?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>&#8220;Saw &#8217;em on the mangrove roots at low tide,
first time I nosed around here. Tide was well
up to-day; but I managed to get these all right
with a little diving. Only trouble, the skeets
most ate me alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie glanced at her companion&#8217;s dry
clothing, and came back to the oysters themselves.
&#8220;These look very tempting. Do you
like them raw?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say I like them much any way, as a rule.
But if I did, I wouldn&#8217;t eat this mess raw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This must be the dry season here, and the
river is running mighty clear. Just the same,
it&#8217;s nothing more than liquid malaria. We&#8217;ll not
eat these oysters till they&#8217;ve been pasteurized.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the water is so dangerous, I fear we will
suffer before we can return,&#8221; replied Miss Leslie,
and she held up the flask.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Blake. &#8220;Half gone already?
That was Winthrope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was very thirsty. Could we not boil a
potful of the river water?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, when the ebb gets strong, if we run too
dry. First, though, we&#8217;ll make a try for cocoanuts.
Let&#8217;s hit out for the nearest grove now.
The main thing is to keep moving.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, Blake caught up the pot and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
club, and started for the thorn clump, leaving
the skin, together with the meat and the salt, for
Miss Leslie to carry. Winthrope was wakened
by a touch of Blake&#8217;s foot, and all three were
soon walking away from the seashore, just within
the shady border of the mangrove wood.</p>

<p>At the first fan-palm Blake stopped to gather
a number of leaves, for their palm-leaf hats were
now cracked and broken. A little farther on a
ruddy antelope, with lyrate horns, leaped out
of the bush before them and dashed off towards
the river before Blake could string his bow. As
if in mockery of his lack of readiness, a troupe of
large green monkeys set up a wild chattering in
a tree above the party.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Miss Jenny, do you think you can lug
the pot, if we go slow? It isn&#8217;t far now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for you, little woman! That&#8217;ll give
me a chance to shoot quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>They moved on again for a hundred yards or
more; but though Blake kept a sharp lookout
both above and below, he saw no game other
than a few small birds and a pair of blue wood-pigeons.
When he sought to creep up on the
latter, they flew into the next tree. In following
them, he came upon a conical mound of hard
clay, nearly four feet high.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>&#8220;Hello; this must be one of those white anthills,&#8221;
he said, and he gave the mound a kick.</p>

<p>Instantly a tiny object whirred up and struck
him in the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whee!&#8221; he exclaimed, springing back and
striking out. &#8220;A hornet! No; it&#8217;s a bee!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did it sting you?&#8221; cried Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sting? Keep back; there&#8217;s a lot more of
&#8217;em. Sting? Oh, no; he only hypodermicked
me with a red-hot darning needle! Shy around
here. There&#8217;s a whole swarm of the little devils,
and they&#8217;re hopping mad. Hear &#8217;em buzz!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where is their hive?&#8221; asked Winthrope,
as all three drew back behind the nearest bushes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess they&#8217;ve borrowed that ant-hill,&#8221; replied
Blake, gingerly fingering the white lump
which marked the spot where the bee had struck
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be delightful if we had some
honey?&#8221; exclaimed Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, that really wouldn&#8217;t be half bad!&#8221;
chimed in Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we can, Miss Jenny; only we&#8217;ll need
a fire to tackle those buzzers. Guess it&#8217;ll be as
well to let them cool off a bit also. The cocoanuts
are only a little way ahead now. Here;
give me the pot.&#8221;</p>

<p>They soon came to a small grove of cocoanut
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
palms, where Blake threw down his club and bow
and handed his burning-glass to Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you and Win start a fire.
It&#8217;s early yet, but I&#8217;m thinking we&#8217;ll all be
ready enough for oyster stew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the meat?&#8221; asked Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep that till later. Here goes for our
dessert.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selecting one of the smaller palms, Blake spat
on his hands, and began to climb the slender
trunk. Aided by previous experiences, he mounted
steadily to the top. The descent was made with
even more care and steadiness, for he did not wish
to tear the skin from his hands again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Win,&#8221; he said, as he neared the bottom
and sprang down, &#8220;leave the cooking to Miss
Leslie, and husk some of those nuts. You won&#8217;t
more&#8217;n have time to do it before the stew is
ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope&#8217;s response was to draw out his penknife.
Blake stretched himself at ease in the
shade, but kept a critical eye on his companions.
Although Winthrope&#8217;s fingers trembled with
weakness, he worked with a precision and rapidity
that drew a grunt of approval from Blake.
Presently Miss Leslie, who had been stirring the
stew with a twig, threw in a little salt, and drew
the pot from the fire.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>&#8220;<i>En avant</i>, gentlemen! Dinner is served,&#8221;
she called gayly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; demanded Blake. &#8220;Oh; sure.
Hold on, Miss Jenny. You&#8217;ll dump it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wrapped a wisp of grass about the pot, and
filled the three cocoanut bowls. The stew was
boiling hot; but they fished up the oysters with
the bamboo forks that Blake had carved some
days since. By the time the oysters were eaten,
the liquor in the bowl was cool enough to drink.
The process was repeated until the pot had been
emptied of its contents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, but that was something like,&#8221; murmured
Blake. &#8220;If only we&#8217;d had pretzels and beer to
go with it! But these nuts won&#8217;t be bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they finished the cocoanuts, Winthrope
asked for a drink of water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it not be best to keep it until later?&#8221;
replied Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; put in Blake. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had enough
liquid refreshments to do any one. If I don&#8217;t look
out, you&#8217;ll both be drinking river water. Just bear
in mind the work I&#8217;d have to carve a pair of gravestones.
No; that flask has got to do you till we
get home. I don&#8217;t shin up any more telegraph
poles to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it not be best for Mr. Winthrope to
rest during the noon hours?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>&#8220;&#8217;Fraid not, Miss Jenny. We&#8217;re not on t&#8217;other
side of Jordan yet, and there&#8217;s no rest for the
weary this side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What odd expressions you use, Mr. Blake!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just giving you the reverse application of
one of those songs they jolly us with in the mission
churches&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure, Mr. Blake&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me, too, Miss Jenny! So, as that&#8217;s settled,
we&#8217;ll be moving. Chuck some live coals in the
pot, and come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>He started off, weapons in hand. Winthrope
made a languid effort to take possession of the pot.
But Miss Leslie pushed him aside, and wrapping
all in the antelope skin, slung it upon her back.</p>

<p>&#8220;The brute!&#8221; exclaimed Winthrope. &#8220;To
leave such a load for you, when he knew that I
can do so little!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl met his outburst with a brave attempt
at a smile. &#8220;Please try to look at the bright side,
Mr. Winthrope. Really, I believe he thinks it is
best for us to exert ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has other opinions with which we of the
cultured class would hardly agree, Miss Leslie.
Consider his command that we shall go thirsty
until he permits us to return to the cliffs. The
man&#8217;s impertinence is intolerable. I shall go to
the river and drink when I choose.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>&#8220;Oh, but the danger of malaria!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense. Malaria, like yellow fever, comes
only from the bite of certain species of mosquitoes.
If we have the fever, it will be entirely his fault.
We have been bitten repeatedly this morning, and
all because he must compel us to come with him
to this infected lowland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, I think we should do what Mr. Blake
says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Miss Genevieve, for your sake I will
endeavor not to break with the fellow. Only, you
know, it is deuced hard to keep one&#8217;s temper when
one considers what a bounder&#8211;what an unmitigated
cad&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! I will not listen to another word!&#8221;
exclaimed the girl, and she hurried after Blake,
leaving Winthrope staring in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;My word!&#8221; he muttered; &#8220;can it be, after
all I&#8217;ve done&#8211;and him, of all the low fellows&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood for several moments in deep thought.
The look on his sallow face was far from pleasant.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SERPENT STRIKES</span></h2>

<p>When Winthrope came up with the
others, they were gathering green
leaves to throw on the fire which was
blazing close beside the ant-hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get a move on you!&#8221; called Blake. &#8220;You&#8217;re
slow. Grab a bunch of leaves, and get into the
smoke, if you don&#8217;t want to be stung.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope neither gathered any leaves nor
hurried himself, until he was visited by a highly
irritated bee. Then he obeyed with alacrity.
Blake was far too intent on other matters to heed
the Englishman. Leaping in and out of the thick
of the smoke, he pounded the ant-hill with his
club, until he had broken a gaping hole into the
cavity. The smoke, pouring into the hive, made
short work of the bees that had not already been
suffocated.</p>

<p>Although the antelope skin was drawn into the
shape of a sack, both it and the pot were filled to
overflowing with honey, and there were still more
combs left than the three could eat.</p>

<p>Blake caught Winthrope smiling with satisfaction
as he licked his fingers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with my expedition now,
old man?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;ah&#8211;must admit, Blake, we have had a
most enjoyable change of food.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are sure it will agree with you,&#8221;
remarked Miss Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am sure of that, Miss Genevieve. I
could digest anything to-day. I&#8217;m fairly ravenous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the more reason to be careful,&#8221; rejoined
Blake. &#8220;I guess, though, what we&#8217;ve had&#8217;ll do
no harm. We&#8217;ll let it settle a bit, here in the
shade, and then hit the home trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could we not first go to the river, Mr. Blake?
My hands are dreadfully sticky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Win will take you. It&#8217;s only a little way to
the bank here and there&#8217;s not much underbrush.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think it&#8217;s quite safe&#8211;&#8221; remarked
Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s safe enough. Go on. You&#8217;ll see the
river in half a minute. Only thing, you&#8217;d better
watch out for alligators.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe that&#8211;er&#8211;properly speaking, these
are crocodiles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say! Heap of difference it will
make if one gets you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie caught Winthrope&#8217;s eye. He
turned on his heel, and led the way for her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
through the first thicket. Beyond this they came
to a little glade which ran through to the river.
When they reached the bank, they stepped cautiously
down the muddy slope, and bathed their
hands in the clear water. As Miss Leslie rose,
Winthrope bent over and began to drink.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Winthrope!&#8221; she exclaimed; &#8220;please
don&#8217;t! In your weak condition, I&#8217;m so afraid&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not alarm yourself. I am perfectly well,
and I am quite as competent to judge what is
good for me as your&#8211;ah&#8211;countryman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Winthrope, I am thinking only of your
own good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope took another deep draught, rinsed
his fingers fastidiously, and arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Miss Genevieve,&#8221; he observed,
&#8220;a woman looks at these matters in such a different
light from a man. But you should know
that there are some things a gentleman cannot
tolerate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were welcome to all the water in the
flask. Surely with that you could have waited,
if only to please me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, if you put it that way, I must beg
pardon. Anything to please you, I&#8217;m sure!
Pray forgive me, and forget the incident. It is
now past.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so!&#8221; she murmured; but her heart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
sank as she glanced at his sallow face, and she
recalled his languid, feeble movements.</p>

<p>Piqued by her look, Winthrope started back
through the glade. Miss Leslie was turning to
follow, when she caught sight of a gorgeous
crimson blossom under the nearest tree. It was
the first flower she had seen since being shipwrecked.
She uttered a little cry of delight, and
ran to pluck the blossom.</p>

<p>Winthrope, glancing about at her exclamation,
saw her stoop over the flower&#8211;and in the same
instant he saw a huge vivid coil, all black and green
and yellow, flash up out of the bedded leaves and
strike against the girl. She staggered back, screaming
with horror, yet seemed unable to run.</p>

<p>Winthrope swung up his stick, and dashed
across the glade towards her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it&#8211;a snake?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>The girl did not seem to hear him. She had
ceased screaming, and stood rigid with fright,
glaring down at the ground before her. In a
moment Winthrope was near enough, to make
out the brilliant glistening body, now extended
full length in the grass. It was nearly five feet
long and thick as his thigh. Another step, and
he saw the hideous triangular head, lifted a few
inches on the thick neck. The cold eyes were
fixed upon the girl in a malignant, deadly stare.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>&#8220;Snake! snake!&#8221; he yelled, and thrust his
cane at the reptile&#8217;s tail.</p>

<p>Again came a flashing leap of the beautiful ornate
coil, and the stick was struck from Winthrope&#8217;s
hand. He danced backward, wild with
excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Snake!&#8211;Hi, Blake! monster!&#8211;Run, Miss
Leslie! I&#8217;ll hold him&#8211;I&#8217;ll get another stick!&#8221;</p>

<p>He darted aside to catch up a branch, and then
ran in and struck boldly at the adder, which reared
hissing to meet him. But the blow fell short, and
the rotten wood shattered on the ground. Again
Winthrope ran aside for a stick. There was none
near, and as he paused to glance about, Blake
came sprinting down the glade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; he shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8211;Hi! look out! You&#8217;ll be on him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake stopped short, barely beyond striking
distance of the hissing reptile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Puff adder! I&#8217;ll fix
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaped back, and thrust his bow at the snake.
The challenge was met by a vicious lunge. Even
where he stood Winthrope heard the thud of the
reptile&#8217;s head upon the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, once more, tootsie!&#8221; mocked Blake,
swinging up his club.</p>

<p>Again the adder struck at the bow tip, more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
viciously than before. With the flash of the
stroke, Blake&#8217;s right foot thrust forward, and his
club came down with all the drive of his sinewy
arm behind it. The blow fell across the thickest
part of the adder&#8217;s outstretched body.</p>

<p>&#8220;Told you so! See him wiggle!&#8221; shouted
Blake. &#8220;Broke his back, first lick&#8211; What&#8217;s the
matter, Miss Jenny? He can&#8217;t do anything now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie did not answer. She stood rigid,
her face ashy-gray, her dilated eyes fixed upon the
writhing, hissing adder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I think the snake struck her!&#8221; gasped
Winthrope, suddenly overcome with horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; cried Blake. He dropped his club,
and rushed to the girl. In a moment he had
knelt before her and flung up her leopard-skin
skirt. Her stockings ripped to shreds in his frantic
grasp. There, a little below her right knee,
was a tiny red wound. Blake put his lips to it,
and sucked with fierce energy.</p>

<p>Then the girl found her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away&#8211;go away! How dare you!&#8221; she
cried, as her face flushed scarlet.</p>

<p>Blake turned, spat, and burst out with a loud
demand of Winthrope: &#8220;Quick! the little knife&#8211;I&#8217;ll have to slash it! Ten times worse than
a rattlesnake&#8211; Lord! you&#8217;re slow&#8211;I&#8217;ll use
mine!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>&#8220;Let go of me&#8211;let go! What do you mean,
sir?&#8221; cried the girl, struggling to free herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold still, you little fool!&#8221; he shouted.
&#8220;It&#8217;s death&#8211;sure death, if I don&#8217;t get the
poison from that bite!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not bitten&#8211; Let go, I say! It struck
in the fold of my skirt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, Jenny, don&#8217;t lie! It&#8217;s
certain death! I saw the mark&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a thorn. I drew it out an hour ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake looked up into her hazel eyes. They
were blazing with indignant scorn. He freed
her, and rose with clumsy slowness. Again he
glanced at her quivering, scarlet face, only to
look away with a sheepish expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you think I&#8217;m just a damned meddlesome
idiot,&#8221; he mumbled.</p>

<p>She did not answer. He stood for a little,
rubbing a finger across his sun-blistered lips.
Suddenly he stopped and looked at the finger.
It was streaked with blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t stop to
think of that! It&#8217;s just as well for me, Miss
Jenny, that wasn&#8217;t an adder bite. A little
poison on my sore lip would have done for me.
Ten to one, we&#8217;d both have turned up our toes
at the same time. Of course, though, that&#8217;d
be nothing to you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>Miss Leslie put her hands before her face, and
burst into hysterical weeping.</p>

<p>Blake looked around, far more alarmed than
when facing the adder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, you blooming lud!&#8221; he shouted;
&#8220;take the lady away, and be quick about it.
She&#8217;ll go dotty if she sees any more snake stunts.
Clear out with her, while I smash the wriggler.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope, who had been staring fixedly at
the beautiful coloring and loathsome form of the
writhing adder, started at Blake&#8217;s harsh command
as though struck.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;er&#8211;to be sure,&#8221; he stammered, and darting
around to the hysterical girl, he took her arm
and hurried her away up the glade.</p>

<p>They had gone several paces when Blake came
running up behind them. Winthrope looked
back with a glance of inquiry. Blake shook his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Give me your cigarette
case. I&#8217;ve thought of something&#8211; Hold on;
take out the cigarettes. Smoke &#8217;em, if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Case in hand, Blake returned to the wounded
adder, and picked up his club. A second smashing
blow would have ended the matter at once;
but Blake did not strike. Instead, he feinted
with his club until he managed to pin down
the venomous head. The club lay across the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
monster&#8217;s neck, and he held it fast with the
pressure of his foot.</p>

<p>When, half an hour later, he wiped his knife
on a wisp of grass and stood up, the cigarette
case contained over a tablespoonful of a crystalline
liquid. He peered in at it, his heavy
jaw thrust out, his eyes glowing with savage
elation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Talk about your meat trusts and Winchesters!&#8221;
he exulted; &#8220;here&#8217;s a whole carload
of beef in this little box&#8211;enough dope
to morgue a herd of steers. Good God, though,
that was a close shave for her!&#8221;</p>

<p>His face sobered, and he stood for several
moments staring thoughtfully into space. Then
his gaze chanced to fall upon the great crimson
blossom which had so nearly lured the girl to
her death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;that&#8217;s an amaryllis.
Wonder if she wasn&#8217;t coming to pick it&#8211;&#8221; He
snapped shut the lid of the cigarette case, thrust
it carefully into his shirt pocket, and stepped
forward to pluck the flower. &#8220;Makes a fellow
feel like a kid; but maybe it&#8217;ll make her feel
less sore at me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood gazing at the flower for several
moments, his eyes aglow with a soft blue light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; he sighed; &#8220;if only&#8211; But what&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
the use? She&#8217;s &#8217;way out of my class&#8211;a rough
brute like me! All the same, it&#8217;s up to me to
take care of her. She can&#8217;t keep me from being
her friend&#8211;and she sure can&#8217;t object to my
picking flowers for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amaryllis in hand, he gathered up his bow
and club. Then he paused to study the skin
of the decapitated adder. The inspection ended
with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better not, Thomas. It would make a dandy
quiver; but then, it might get on her nerves.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he came to the ant-hill, he found companions
and honey alike gone. He went on
to the cocoanuts. There he came upon Winthrope
stretched flat beside the skin of honey.
Miss Leslie was seated a little way beyond, nervously
bending a palm-leaf into shape for a hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Blake,&#8221; drawled Winthrope, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
been a deuced long time in coming. It was no
end of a task to lug the honey&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake brushed past without replying, and went
on until he stood before the girl. As she glanced
up at him, he held out the crimson blossom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought you might like posies,&#8221; he said, in
a hesitating voice.</p>

<p>Instead of taking the flower, she drew back
with a gesture of repulsion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, take it away!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>Blake flung the rejected gift on the ground,
and crushed it beneath his heel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Catch me making a fool of myself again!&#8221;
he growled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I did not mean it that way&#8211;really I
didn&#8217;t, Mr. Blake. It was the thought of that
awful snake.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Blake, cut to the quick, had turned away,
far too angry to heed what she said. He stopped
short beside the Englishman; but only to sling
the skin of honey upon his back. The load was
by no means a light one, even for his strength.
Yet he caught up the heavy pot as well, and
made off across the plain at a pace which the
others could not hope to equal.</p>

<p>As Winthrope rose and came forward to join
Miss Leslie, he looked about closely for the
bruised flower. It was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Er&#8211;beg pardon, Miss Genevieve, but did
not Blake drop the bloom&#8211;er&#8211;blossom somewhere
about here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he did,&#8221; replied Miss Leslie. She
spoke with studied indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;ah&#8211;saw the fellow exhibit his impudence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, I think it high time the bounder
is taken down a peg.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>&#8220;Ah, indeed! Then why do you not try it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Genevieve! you know that at present I
am physically so much his inferior&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about mentally?&#8221;</p>

<p>Though the girl&#8217;s eyes were veiled by their
lashes, she saw Winthrope cast after Blake a look
that seemed to her almost fiercely vindictive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she said, smiling, but watching him
closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mentally!&#8211;We&#8217;ll soon see about that!&#8221; he
muttered. &#8220;I must say, Miss Genevieve, it
strikes me as deuced odd, you know, to hear
you speak so pleasantly of a person who&#8211;not to
mention past occurrences&#8211;has to-day, with the
most shocking disregard of&#8211;er&#8211;decency&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8211;stop this instant!&#8221; screamed the girl,
her nerves overwrought.</p>

<p>Winthrope smiled with complacent assurance.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear young lady,&#8221; he drawled, &#8220;allow
me to repeat, &#8216;All is fair in love and war.&#8217;
Believe me, I love you most ardently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No gentleman would press his suit at such a
time as this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really now, I fancy I have always comported
myself as a gentleman&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A trifle too much so, truth to say!&#8221; she
retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, indeed. However, this is now quite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
another matter. Has it not occurred to you, my
dear, that this entire experience of ours since that
beastly storm is rather&#8211;er&#8211;compromising?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8211;you dare say such a thing! I&#8217;ll go
this instant and tell Mr. Blake! I&#8217;ll&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Begging your pardon, madam,&#8211;but are you
prepared to marry that barbarous clodhopper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry? What do you mean, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely that. It is a question of marriage,
if you&#8217;ll pardon me. And, you see, I flatter
myself, that when it comes to the point, it will
not be Blake, but myself&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, indeed! And if I should prefer neither
of you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Begging your pardon,&#8211;I fancy you will
honor me with your hand, my dear. For one
thing, you admit that I am a gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment, please! I am trying to intimate
to you, as delicately as possible, how&#8211;er&#8211;embarrassing you would find it to have these
little occurrences&#8211;above all, to-day&#8217;s&#8211;noised
abroad to the vulgar crowd, or even among your
friends&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? What do you
want?&#8221; cried the girl, staring at him with a
deepening fear in her bewildered eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me, my dear, it grieves me to so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
perturb you; but&#8211;er&#8211;love must have its way,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget. There is Mr. Blake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, to be sure! But really now, you would
not ask, or even permit him to murder me; and
one is not legally bound, you know, to observe
promises&#8211;a pledge of silence, for example&#8211;when
extorted under duress, under violence, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie looked the Englishman up and
down, her brown eyes sparkling with quick-returning
anger. He met her scorn with a smile
of smug complacency.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cad!&#8221; she cried, and turning her back upon
him, she set out across the plain after Blake.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE EAVESDROPPER CAUGHT</span></h2>

<p>Even had it not been for her doubts of
Blake, the girl&#8217;s modesty would have
caused her to think twice before repeating
to him the Englishman&#8217;s insulting proposal.
While she yet hesitated and delayed, Winthrope
came down with a second attack of fever. Blake,
who until then had held himself sullenly apart
from him as well as from Miss Leslie, at once
softened to a gentler, or, at least, to a more considerate
mood. Though his speech and bearing
continued morose, he took upon himself all
the duties of night nurse, besides working and
foraging several hours each day.</p>

<p>Much to Miss Leslie&#8217;s surprise, she found herself
tending the invalid through the daytime almost
as though nothing had happened. But
everything about this wild and perilous life was
so strange and unnatural to her that she found herself
accepting the most unconventional relations
as a regular consequence of the situation. She
was feverishly eager for anything that might
occupy her mind; for she felt that to brood over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
the future might mean madness. The mere
thought of the possibilities was far too terrifying
to be calmly dwelt upon. Though slight,
there had been some little comfort in the belief
that she could rely on Winthrope. But now she
was left alone with her doubt and dread. Even
if she had nothing to fear from Blake, there were
all the savage dangers of the coast, and behind
those, far worse, the fever.</p>

<p>Meantime Blake went about his share of the
camp work, gruff and silent, but with the usual
concrete results. He brought load after load of
fresh cocoanuts, and took great pains to hunt out
the deliciously flavored eggs of the frigate birds
to tempt Winthrope&#8217;s failing appetite. When
Miss Leslie suggested that beef juice would be
much better for the invalid than broth, he went
out immediately in search of a gum-bearing tree,
and that night, after heating a small quantity of
gum in the cigarette case with the adder poison,
he spent hours replacing his arrow-heads with
small barbed tips that could be loosened from
their sockets by a slight pull.</p>

<p>A little before dawn he dipped two of his new
arrow-heads in the sticky contents of the cigarette
case, fitted them carefully to their shafts, and
stole away down the cleft. Dawn found him
crouched low in the grass where the overflow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
from the pool ran out into the plain along its
little channel. He could see large forms moving
away from him; then came the flood of
crimson light, and he made out that the figures
were a drove of huge eland.</p>

<p>His eyes flashed with eagerness. It was a long
shot; but he knew that no more was required than
to pierce the skin on any part of his quarry&#8217;s body.
He put his fingers between his teeth, and sent out
a piercing whistle. It was a trick he had tried
more than once on deer and pronghorn antelope.
As he expected, the eland halted and swung half
around. Their ox-like sides presented a mark
hard to miss.</p>

<p>He rose and shot as they were wheeling to fly.
Before he could fit his second arrow to the string,
the whole herd were running off at a lumbering
gallop. He lowered his bow, and walked after
the animals, smiling with grim anticipation. He
had seen his arrow strike against the side of the
young bull at which he had aimed.</p>

<p>A little beyond where the bull had stood, he
came upon the headless shaft of his arrow. As he
stooped and caught it up, he saw one of the fleeing
animals fall. When he came up with the dead
bull, his first act was to recover his arrow-tip and
cut out the flesh around the wound. Provided
only with his weak-bladed knife, he found it no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
easy task to butcher so large a beast. Though he
had now acquired considerable dexterity in the
art, noon had passed before he brought the first
load of meat up the cleft.</p>

<p>So great was the abundance of meat that Blake
worked all the remainder of the day and all night
stringing the flesh on the curing racks, and Miss
Leslie tried out pot after pot of fat and tallow,
until every spare vessel was filled, and she had to
resort to a hollow in the rock beside the spring.
Blake promised to make more pots as soon as he
could fetch the clay, but he had first to dress the
eland hide, and prepare a new stock of thread and
cord from parts of the animal which he was careful
not to let her see.</p>

<p>Whatever their concern for the future,&#8211;and
even Blake&#8217;s was keen and bitter,&#8211;the party, as
a party, for the time being might have been considered
extremely fortunate. They had a shelter
secure alike from the weather and from wild
beasts; an abundance of nutritious food, and, as
material for clothing, the bushbuck, hyena, and
eland hides. To obtain more skins and more meat
Blake now knew would be a simple matter so long
as he had enough poison left in the cigarette case
to moisten the tips of his arrows.</p>

<p>Even Winthrope&#8217;s relapse proved far less serious
than might reasonably have been expected. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
fever soon left him, and within a few days he
regained strength enough to care for himself.
Here, however, much to Blake&#8217;s perplexity and
concern, his progress seemed to stop, and all
Blake&#8217;s urging could do no more than cause him
to move languidly from one shady spot to another.
He would receive Blake&#8217;s orders with a smile and
a drawling &#8220;Ya-as, to be sure!&#8221;&#8211;and would
then absolutely ignore the matter.</p>

<p>Only in two ways did the invalid exhibit any
signs of energy. He could and did eat with a
heartiness little short of that shown by Blake,
and he would insist upon seeking opportunities
to press his attentions upon Miss Leslie. He was
careful to avoid all offensive remarks; yet the
veriest commonplace from his lips was now an
offence to the girl. While he needed her as
nurse, she had endured his talk as part of her
duty. But now she felt that she could no longer
do so. Taking advantage of a time when the
Englishman was, as she supposed, enjoying a
noonday siesta down towards the barricade, she
went to meet Blake, who had been up on the cliff
for eggs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he sang out, as he swung down the
tree, one hand gripping the clay pot in which he
had gathered the eggs. &#8220;What you doing out
in the sun? Get into the shade.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>She stepped into the shade, and waited until
he had climbed down the pile of stones which he
had built for steps at the foot of the tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Blake,&#8221; she began, &#8220;could not I do this
work,&#8211;gather the eggs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could, if I&#8217;d let you, Miss Jenny. But it
strikes me you&#8217;ve got quite enough to do. Tell
you the truth, I&#8217;d like to make Win take it in hand
again. But all my cussing won&#8217;t budge him an
inch, and you know, when it comes to the rub, I
couldn&#8217;t wallop a fellow who can hardly stand up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he really so weak?&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you know how&#8211; Say, you don&#8217;t
mean that you think he&#8217;s shamming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not say that I thought so, Mr. Blake.
I do not care to talk about him. What I wish is
that you will let me attend to this work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t think of it, Miss Jenny! You&#8217;re
already doing your share.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Blake,&#8211;if you must know,&#8211;I wish to
have a place where I can go and be apart&#8211;alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake scowled. &#8220;Alone with that dude! He&#8217;d
soon find enough strength to climb up with you
on the cliff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;ah&#8211;Mr. Blake, would he be apt to
follow me, if I told you distinctly I should rather
be alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would he? Well, I should rather guess
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
not!&#8221; cried Blake, making no attempt to conceal
his delight. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give him a hint that&#8217;ll make
his hair curl. From now on, nobody climbs
up this tree but you, without first asking your
permission.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Blake! You are very kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kind to let you do more work! But say,
I&#8217;ll help out all I can on the other work. You
know, Miss Jenny,&#8211;a rough fellow like me don&#8217;t
know how to say it, but he can think it just the
same,&#8211;I&#8217;d do anything in the world for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, he held out his rough, powerful
hand. She shrank back a little, and caught her
breath in sudden fright. But when she met his
steady gaze, her fear left her as quickly as it had
come. She impulsively thrust out her hand, and
he seized it in a grip that brought the tears to her
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Jenny! Miss Jenny!&#8221; he murmured,
utterly unconscious that he was hurting her,
&#8220;you know now that I&#8217;m your friend, Miss
Jenny!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Blake,&#8221; she answered, blushing and
drawing her hand free. &#8220;I believe you are a
friend&#8211;I believe I can trust you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can, by&#8211;Jiminy! But say,&#8221; he continued,
blundering with dense stupidity, &#8220;do you
really mean that? Can you forgive me for being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
so confounded meddlesome, the other day, after
the snake&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped short, for upon the instant she was
facing him, as on that eventful day, scarlet with
shame and anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you speak of it?&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;You&#8217;re&#8211;you&#8217;re not a gentleman!&#8221;</p>

<p>Before he could reply, she turned and left him,
walking rapidly and with her head held high.
Blake stared after her in bewilderment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what in&#8211;what in thunder have I done
now?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Ladies are certainly
mighty funny! To go off at a touch&#8211;and just
when I thought we were going to be chums!
But then, of course, I&#8217;ve the whole thing to
learn about nice girls&#8211;like her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;ah&#8211;must certainly agree with you there,
Blake,&#8221; drawled Winthrope, from beside the
nearest bush.</p>

<p>Blake turned upon him with savage fury:
&#8220;You dirty sneak!&#8211;you <i>gentleman!</i> You&#8217;ve
been eavesdropping!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Englishman&#8217;s yellow face paled to a sallow
mottled gray. He had seen the same look in
Blake&#8217;s eyes twice before, and this time Blake
was far more angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;You sneak!&#8211;you sham gent!&#8221; repeated the
American, his voice sinking ominously.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>Winthrope dropped in an abject heap, as though
Blake had struck him with his club.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; he protested shrilly. &#8220;I am a real&#8211;I am&#8211;I&#8217;m a not&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it&#8211;you&#8217;re a not! That&#8217;s true!&#8221;
broke in Blake, with sudden grim humor.
&#8220;You&#8217;re a nothing. A fellow can&#8217;t even wipe
his shoes on nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>The change to sarcasm came as an immense
relief to Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I say now, Blake,&#8221; he drawled, pulling
together his assurance the instant the dangerous
light left Blake&#8217;s eyes, &#8220;I say now, do you think
it fair to pick on a man who is so much your&#8211;er&#8211;who is ill and weak?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it&#8211;do the baby act,&#8221; jeered Blake.
&#8220;But say, I don&#8217;t know just how much eavesdropping
you did; so there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ll repeat
for the special benefit of your ludship. It&#8217;ll be
good for your delicate health to pay attention.
From now on, the cliff top belongs to Miss Leslie.
Gents and book agents not allowed. Understand?
You don&#8217;t go up there without her
special invite. If you do, I&#8217;ll twist your damned
neck!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned on his heel, and left the Englishman
cowering.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>AN OMINOUS LULL</span></h2>

<p>The three saw nothing more of each other
that day. Miss Leslie had withdrawn into
the baobab, and Blake had gone off down
the cleft for more salt. He did not return until
after the others were asleep. Miss Leslie had
gone without her supper, or had eaten some of
the food stored within the tree.</p>

<p>When, late the next morning, she finally left her
seclusion, Blake was nowhere in sight. Ignoring
Winthrope&#8217;s attempts to start a conversation, she
hurried through her breakfast, and having gathered
a supply of food and water, went to spend the day
on the headland.</p>

<p>Evening forced her to return to the cleft.
She had emptied the water flask by noon, and
was thirsty. Winthrope was dozing beneath his
canopy, which Blake had moved some yards
down towards the barricade. Blake was cooking
supper.</p>

<p>He did not look up, and met her attempt at
a pleasant greeting with an inarticulate grunt.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
When she turned to enter the baobab, she found
the opening littered with bamboos and green
creepers and pieces of large branches with charred
ends. On either side, midway through the entrance,
a vertical row of holes had been sunk
through the bark of the tree into the soft wood.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Are you planning
a porch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should you make the holes so far in?
I know so little about these matters, but I should
have fancied the holes would come on the front of
the tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see in a day or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you make the holes? They look
black, as though&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Burnt &#8217;em, of course&#8211;hot stones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was so clever of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>He made no response.</p>

<p>Supper was eaten in silence. Even Winthrope&#8217;s
presence would have been a relief to the girl; yet
she could not go to waken him, or even suggest
that her companion do so. Blake sat throughout
the meal sullen and stolid, and carefully avoided
meeting her gaze. Before they had finished, twilight
had come and gone, and night was upon
them. Yet she lingered for a last attempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, friend!&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>He sprang up as though she had struck him,
and blundered away into the darkness.</p>

<p>In the morning it was as before. He had gone
off before she wakened. She lingered over breakfast;
but he did not appear, and she could not
endure Winthrope&#8217;s suave drawl. She went for
another day on the headland.</p>

<p>She returned somewhat earlier than on the previous
day. As before, Winthrope was dozing in
the shade. But Blake was under the baobab, raking
together a heap of rubbish. His hands were
scratched and bleeding. To the girl&#8217;s surprise, he
met her with a cheerful grin and a clear, direct
glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>She stepped around the baobab, and stood
staring. The entrance, from the ground to the
height of twelve feet, was walled up with a mass
of thorny branches, interwoven with yet thornier
creepers.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that for a front door?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Door?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s so big. I could never move it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A child could. Look.&#8221; He grasped a projecting
handle near the bottom of the thorny mass.
The lower half of the door swung up and outward,
the upper half in and downward. &#8220;See; it&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
balanced on a crossbar in the middle. Come
on in.&#8221;</p>

<p>She walked after him in under the now horizontal
door. He gave the inner end a light upward
thrust, and the door swung back in its vertical
circle until it again stood upright in the opening.
From the inside the girl could see the strong
framework to which was lashed the facing of
thorns. It was made of bamboo and strong
pieces of branches, bound together with tough
creepers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty good grating, eh?&#8221; remarked Blake.
&#8220;When those green creepers dry, they&#8217;ll shrink
and hold tight as iron clamps. Even now nothing
short of a rhinoceros could walk through
when the bars are fast. See here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped up to the novel door, and slid
several socketed crossbars until their outer ends
were deep in the holes in the tree trunk, three
on each side.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that for a set of bolts?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderful! Really, you are very, very
clever! But why should you go to all this
trouble, when the barricade&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, it&#8217;s best to be on the safe
side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s absurd for you to go to all this
needless work. Not that I do not appreciate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
your kind thought for my safety. Yet look at
your hands!&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake hastened to put his bleeding hands behind
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are no sight for a lady!&#8221; he muttered
apologetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and wash them at once, and I&#8217;ll put on a
dressing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake glowed with frank pleasure, yet shook
his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you, Miss Jenny. You needn&#8217;t
bother. They&#8217;ll do all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must! It would please me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then, of course&#8211; But first, I want
to make sure you understand fastening the door.
Try the bars yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>She obeyed, sliding the bars in and out until
he nodded his satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now promise me you&#8217;ll
slide &#8217;em fast every night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you ask it. But why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to make perfectly safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Safe? But am I not secure with&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Miss Leslie; I&#8217;m not going to
say anything about anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you had better say no more, Mr.
Blake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. But whatever happens, you&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
believe I&#8217;ve done my best, won&#8217;t you?&#8211;even if
I&#8217;m not a&#8211; Promise me straight, you&#8217;ll lock up
tight every night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, I promise,&#8221; responded the girl,
not a little troubled by the strangeness of his
expression.</p>

<p>He turned at once, swung open the door, and
went out. During supper he was markedly taciturn,
and immediately afterwards went off to his
bed.</p>

<p>That night Miss Leslie dutifully fastened herself
in with all six bars. She wakened at dawn,
and hastened out to prepare Blake&#8217;s breakfast,
but she found herself too late. There were evidences
that he had eaten and gone off before
dawn. The stretching frame of one of the antelope
skins had been moved around by the fire,
and on the smooth inner surface of the hide was a
laconic note, written with charcoal in a firm, bold
hand:&#8211;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Exploring inland. Back by night, if can</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>She bit her lip in her disappointment, for she
had planned to show him how much she appreciated
his absurd but well-meant concern for her
safety. As it was, he had gone off without a
word, and left her to the questionable pleasure of
a <i>tte--tte</i> with Winthrope. Hoping to avoid
this, she hurried her preparations for a day on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
cliff. But before she could get off, Winthrope
sauntered up, hiding his yawns behind a hand
which had regained most of its normal plumpness.
His eye was at once caught by the charcoal
note.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he drawled; &#8220;really now, this is too
kind of him to give us the pleasure of his
absence all day!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es!&#8221; murmured Miss Leslie. &#8220;Permit
me to add that you will also have the pleasure of
my absence. I am going now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope looked down, and began to speak
very rapidly: &#8220;Miss Genevieve, I&#8211;I wish to
apologize. I&#8217;ve thought it over. I&#8217;ve made a
mistake&#8211;I&#8211;I mean, my conduct the other
day was vile, utterly vile! Permit me to appeal
to your considerateness for a man who has been
unfortunate&#8211;who, I mean, has been&#8211;er&#8211;was
carried away by his feelings. Your favoring of
that bloom&#8211;er&#8211;that&#8211;er&#8211;bounder so angered
me that I&#8211;that I&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Winthrope!&#8221; interrupted the girl, &#8220;I will
have you to understand that you do not advance
yourself in my esteem by such references to Mr.
Blake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye! aye, that Blake!&#8221; panted Winthrope.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see? It&#8217;s &#8217;im, an&#8217; that blossom!
W&#8217;en a man&#8217;s daffy&#8211;w&#8217;en &#8217;e&#8217;s in love!&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>Miss Leslie burst into a nervous laugh; but
checked herself on the instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Mr. Winthrope!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;you
must pardon me. I&#8211;I never knew that cultured
Englishmen ever dropped their h&#8217;s. As it happens,
you know, I never saw one excited before
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes; to be sure&#8211;to be sure!&#8221; murmured
Winthrope, in an odd tone.</p>

<p>The girl threw out her hand in a little gesture
of protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, I&#8217;m sorry to have hurt&#8211;to have been
so thoughtless!&#8221;</p>

<p>Winthrope stood silent. She spoke again: &#8220;I&#8217;ll
do what you ask. I&#8217;ll make allowances for your&#8211;for your feelings towards me, and will try to
forget all you said the other day. Let me begin
by asking a favor of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Miss Genevieve, anything, to be sure, that
I may do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is that I wish your opinion. When Mr.
Blake finished that absurd door last evening, he
would not tell me why he had built it&#8211;only a
vague statement about my safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! He did not go into particulars?&#8221;
drawled Winthrope.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not even a hint; and he looked so&#8211;odd.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>Winthrope slowly rubbed his soft palms on
upon the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you&#8211;er&#8211;really desire to know his&#8211;the motive which actuated him?&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should not have mentioned it to you, if I
did not,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8211;er&#8211;&#8221; He hesitated and paused for
a full minute. &#8220;You see, it is a rather difficult
undertaking to intimate such a matter to a lady&#8211;just the right touch of delicacy, you know.
But I will begin by explaining that I have known
it since the first&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Known what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of that bound&#8211;of&#8211;er&#8211;Blake&#8217;s trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Perhaps I should have said affliction;
yes, that is the better word. To own the truth,
the fellow has some good qualities. It was no
doubt because he realised, when in his better
moments&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better moments? Mr. Winthrope, I am not
a child. In justice both to myself and to Mr.
Blake, I must ask you to speak out plainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Miss Leslie, may I first ask if you
have not observed how strangely at times the fellow
acts,&#8211;&#8216;looks odd,&#8217; as you put it,&#8211;how he
falls into melancholia or senseless rages? I may
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
truthfully state that he has three times threatened
my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I thought his anger quite natural, after I
had so rudely&#8211;and so many people are given to
brooding&#8211; But if he was violent to you&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Miss Genevieve, I hold nothing
against the miserable fellow. At such times he is
not&#8211;er&#8211;responsible, you know. Let us give
the fellow full credit&#8211;that is why he himself
built your door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but I can&#8217;t believe it! I can&#8217;t believe
it!&#8221; cried the girl. &#8220;It&#8217;s not possible! He&#8217;s so
strong, so true and manly, so kind, for all his
gruffness!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my dear!&#8221; soothed Winthrope, &#8220;that is
the pity of it. But when a man must needs be
his worst enemy, when he must needs lead a certain
kind of life, he must take the consequences.
To put it as delicately as possible, yet explain all,
I need only say one word&#8211;paranoia.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie gathered up her day&#8217;s outfit with
trembling fingers, and went to mount the cliff.</p>

<p>After waiting a few minutes Winthrope walked
hurriedly through the cleft, and climbed the tree-ladder
with an agility that would have amazed
his companions. But he did not draw himself up
on the cliff. Having satisfied himself that Miss
Leslie was well out toward the signal, he returned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
to the baobab, and proceeded to examine Blake&#8217;s
door with minute scrutiny.</p>

<p>That evening, shortly before dark, Blake came
in almost exhausted by his journey. Few men
could have covered the same ground in twice the
time. It had been one continuous round of grass
jungle, thorn scrub, rocks, and swamp. And for
all his pains, he brought back with him nothing
more than the discouraging information that the
back-country was worse than the shore. Yet
he betrayed no trace of depression over the
bad news, and for all his fatigue, maintained a
tone of hearty cheerfulness until, having eaten
his fill, he suddenly observed Miss Leslie&#8217;s frigid
politeness.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up now?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;You&#8217;re
not mad &#8217;cause I hiked off this morning without
notice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, of course not, Mr. Blake. Nothing of
the kind. But I&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,-what?&#8221; he broke in, as she hesitated.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t, for the world, think of anything else
I&#8217;ve done&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done! Perhaps I might suggest that
it is a question of what you haven&#8217;t done.&#8221; The
girl was trembling on the verge of hysterics.
&#8220;Yes, what you&#8217;ve not done! All these weeks,
and not a single attempt to get us away from here,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
except that miserable signal; and I as good as
put that up! You call yourself a man! But I&#8211;I&#8211;&#8221; She stopped short, white with a sudden
overpowering fear.</p>

<p>Winthrope looked from her to Blake with
a sidelong glance, his lips drawn up in an odd
twist.</p>

<p>There followed several moments of tense
silence; then Blake mumbled apologetically:
&#8220;Well, I suppose I might have done more. I
was so dead anxious to make sure of food and
shelter. But this trip to-day&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr.&#8211;Mr. Blake, pray do not get excited&#8211;I&#8211;I
mean, please excuse me. I&#8217;m&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re coming down sick!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! I have no fever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s the sun. Yet you ought to keep up
there where the air is freshest. I&#8217;ll make you
a shade.&#8221;</p>

<p>She protested, and withdrew, somewhat hurriedly,
to her tree.</p>

<p>In the morning Blake was gone again; but instead
of a note, beside the fire stood the smaller
antelope skin, converted into a great bamboo-ribbed
sunshade.</p>

<p>She spent the day as usual on the headland.
There was no wind, and the sun was scorching
hot. But with her big sunshade to protect her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
from the direct rays, the heat was at least endurable.
She even found energy to work at a basket
which she was attempting to weave out of long,
coarse grass; yet there were frequent intervals
when her hands sank idle in her lap, and she
gazed away over the shimmering glassy expanse
of the ocean.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the heat became oppressively
sultry, and a long slow swell began to roll shoreward
from beyond the distant horizon, showing no
trace of white along its oily crests until they broke
over the coral reefs. There was not a breath of
air stirring, and for a time the reefs so checked
the rollers that they lacked force to drive on in
and break upon the beach.</p>

<p>Steadily, however, the swell grew heavier,
though not so much as a cat&#8217;s-paw ruffled the
dead surfaces of the watery hillocks. By sunset
they were rolling high over both lines of reefs
and racing shoreward to break upon the beach
and the cliff foot in furious surf. The still air reverberated
with the booming of the breakers.
Yet the girl, inland bred and unversed in weather
lore, sat heedless and indifferent, her eyes fixed
upon the horizon in a vacant stare.</p>

<p>Her reverie was at last disturbed by the peculiar
behavior of the seafowl. Those in the air
circled around in a manner strange to her, while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
their mates on the ledges waddled restlessly about
over and between their nests. There was a
shriller note than usual in their discordant
clamor.</p>

<p>Yet even when she gave heed to the birds, the
girl failed to realize their alarm or to sense the
impending danger. It was only that a feeling of
disquiet had broken the spell of her reverie; it did
not obtrude upon the field of her conscious thought.
She sighed, and rose to return to the cleft, idly
wondering that the air should seem more sultry
than at mid-day. The peculiar appearance of the
sun and the western sky meant nothing more to
her than an odd effect of color and light. She
smilingly compared it with an attempt at a sunset
painted by an artist friend of the impressionist
school.</p>

<p>Neither Winthrope nor Blake was in sight when
she reached the baobab, and neither appeared,
though she delayed supper until dark. It was quite
possible that they had eaten before her return and
had gone off again, the Englishman to doze, and
Blake on an evening hunt.</p>

<p>At last, tired of waiting, she covered the fire,
and retired into her tree-cave. The air in the cleft
was still more stifling than on the headland. She
paused, with her hand upraised to close the swinging
door. She had propped it open when she came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
out in the morning. After a moment&#8217;s hesitation,
she went on across the hollow, leaving the door
wide open.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will rest a little, and close it later,&#8221; she
sighed. She was feeling weary and depressed.</p>

<p>An hour passed. An ominous stillness lay
upon the cleft. Even the cicadas had hushed
their shrill note. The only sound was a muffled
reverberating echo of the surf roaring upon the
seashore. Beneath the giant spread of the baobab
all was blackness.</p>

<p>Something moved in a bush a little way down
the cleft. A crouching figure appeared, dimly
outlined in the starlight. The figure crept stealthily
across into the denser night of the baobab.
The darkness closed about it like a shroud.</p>

<p>A blinding flash of light pierced the blackness.
The figure halted and crouched lower, though the
flash had gone again in a fraction of a second. A
dull rumbling mingled with the ceaseless boom of
the surf.</p>

<p>A second flash lighted the cleft with its dazzling
coruscation. This time the creeping figure did
not halt.</p>

<p>Again and again the forked lightning streaked
across the sky, every stroke more vivid than the
one before. The rumble of the distant thunder
deepened to a heavy rolling which dominated the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
dull roar of the breakers. The storm was coming
with the on-rush of a tornado. Yet the leaves
hung motionless in the still air, and there was no
sound other than the thunder and the booming
of the surf.</p>

<p>The lightning flared, one stroke upon the other,
with a brilliancy that lit up the cave&#8217;s interior
brighter than at mid-day.</p>

<p>In the white glare the girl saw Winthrope,
crouched beneath her upswung door; and his
face was as the face of a beast.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE HURRICANE BLAST</span></h2>

<p>For a moment that seemed a moment of
eternity, she lay on her bed, staring into
the blank darkness. The storm burst
with a crashing uproar that brought her to her
feet, with a shriek. Her giant tree creaked and
strained under the impact of the terrific hurricane
blasts that came howling through the cleft like
a rout of shrieking fiends. The peals of thunder
merged into one continuous roar, beneath which
the solid ledges of rock jarred and quivered.
The sky was a pall of black clouds, meshed
with a dazzling network of forked lightning.</p>

<p>The girl stood motionless, stunned by the uproar,
appalled by the blinding glare of the thunder-bolts;
yet even more fearful of the figure
which every flash showed her still lurking beneath
the door. A gust-borne bough struck with
numbing force against her upraised arm. But
she took no heed. She was unaware of the swirl
of rain and sticks and leaves that was driving in
through the open entrance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>On a sudden the door shook free from its props
and whirled violently around on its balance-bar.
There was a shriek that pierced above the shrilling
of the cyclone,&#8211;a single human shriek.</p>

<p>The girl sprang across the cave. The heavy
door swished up before her and down again, its
lower edge all but grazing her face. For a moment
it stopped in a vertical position, and hung
quivering, like a beast about to leap upon its
prey. Too excited to comprehend the danger of
the act, the girl sprang forward and shot one
of the thick bars into its socket.</p>

<p>A fierce gust leaped against the outer face of
the door and thrust in upon it, striving to burst it
bodily from its bearings. The top and the free
side of the bottom bowed in. But the branches
were still green and tough, the bamboo like
whalebone, and the shrunken creepers held the
frame together as though the joints were lashed
with wire rope. Failing to smash in the elastic
structure, or to snap the crossbar, it were as if
the blast flung itself alternately against the top
and bottom in a fierce attempt to again whirl
the frame about. The white glare streaming in
through the interstices showed the girl her opportunity.
She grasped another bar and shot it into
its socket as the lower part of the door gave back
with the shifting of the pressure to the top. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
was then a simple matter to slide the remaining
bars into the deep-sunk holes. Within half a
minute she had made the door fast, from the
first bar to the sixth.</p>

<p>A heavy spray was beating in upon her through
the chinks of the framework. She drew back and
sought shelter in a niche at the side. Narrow as
was the slit above the top of the door, it let in a
torrent of water, which spouted clear across and
against the far wall of the cave. It gushed down
upon her bed and was already flooding the cave
floor.</p>

<p>She piled higher the cocoanuts stored in her
niche, and perched herself upon the heap to keep
above the water. But even in her sheltered corner
the eddying wind showered her with spray.
She waded across for her skin-covered sunshade,
and returned to huddle beneath it, in the still
misery and terror of a hunted animal that has
crept wounded into a hole.</p>

<p>During the first hurricane there had been companions
to whom she could look for help and
comfort, and she had been to a degree unaware
of the greatness of the danger. But in the few
short weeks since, she had caught more than one
glimpse of Primeval Nature,&#8211;she of the bloody
fang, blind, remorseless, insensate, destroying,
ever destroying.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>True, this was on solid land, while before there
had been the peril of the sea. But now the girl
was alone. Outside the straining walls of her
refuge, the hurricane yelled and shrieked and
roared,&#8211;a headless, formless monster, furious to
burst in upon her, to overthrow her stanch old
tree giant, that in his fall his shattered trunk
might crush and mangle her. Or at any instant
a thunder-bolt might rend open the great tower
of living wood, and hurl her blackened body into
the pool on the cave floor.</p>

<p>Once she fancied that she heard Blake shouting
outside the door; but when she screamed a shrill
response, the blast mocked her with echoing
shrieks, and she dared not venture to free the
door. If it were Blake, he did not shout again.
After a time she began to think that the sound
had been no more than a freak of the shifting
wind. Yet the thought of him out in the full
fury of the cyclone served to turn her thoughts
from her own danger. She prayed aloud for his
safety, beseeching her God that he be spared.
She sought to pray even for Winthrope. But
the vision of that beastly face rose up before her,
and she could not&#8211;then.</p>

<p>Presently she became aware of a change in the
storm. The terrific gusts blew with yet greater violence,
the thunder crashed heavier, the lightning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
filled the air with a flame of dazzling white
light. But the rain no longer gushed across on
the spot where her bed had been. It was entering
at a different angle, and its force was broken
by the bend in the thick wall of the entrance.
After a time the deluge dashed aslant the entrance,
gushing down the door in a cataract of
foam.</p>

<p>Another interval, and the driving downpour no
longer struck even the edge of the opening. The
wind was veering rapidly as the cyclone centre
moved past on one side. The area of the hurricane
was little more than thrice that of a tornado,
and it was advancing along its course at great
speed. An hour more, and the outermost rim of
the huge whirl was passing over the cleft.</p>

<p>Quickly the hurricane gusts fell away to a
gale; the gale became a breeze; the breeze lulled
and died away, stifled by the torrential rain.</p>

<p>Within the baobab all was again dark and silent.
Utterly exhausted, the girl had sunk back
against the friendly wall of the tree, and fallen
asleep.</p>

<p>She was wakened by a hoarse call: &#8220;Miss
Jenny! Miss Jenny, answer me! Are you all
right?&#8221;</p>

<p>She started up, barely saving herself from a
fall as the big unhusked nuts rolled beneath her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
feet. The morning sunlight was streaming in over
her door. She sprang down ankle-deep into the
mire of the cave floor, and ran to loosen the bars.
As the door swung up, she darted out, with a cry
of delight: &#8220;You are safe&#8211;safe! Oh, I was so
afraid for you! But you&#8217;re drenched! You
must build a fire&#8211;dry yourself&#8211;at once!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; said Blake. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to tell you
something.&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught her outstretched hands, and pushed
them down with gentle force. His face was grave,
almost solemn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think you can stand bad news&#8211;a shock?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211; What is it? You look so strange!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about Winthrope,&#8211;something very
bad&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned, with a gasp, and hid her face in
her hands, shuddering with horror and loathing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! oh!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I know already&#8211;I
know all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All?&#8221; demanded Blake, staring blankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; all! And&#8211;and he made me think it
was you!&#8221; She gasped, and fell silent.</p>

<p>Blake&#8217;s face went white. He spoke in a clear,
vibrant voice, tense as an overstrained violin
string: &#8220;I am speaking about Winthrope&#8211;understand
me?&#8211;Winthrope. He has been badly
hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>&#8220;The door swung down and struck him, when
he was creeping in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; roared Blake. &#8220;I picked him up
like a sick baby&#8211;the beast!&#8211;&#8217;stead of grinding
my heel in his face! God! I&#8217;ll&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom! don&#8217;t&#8211;don&#8217;t even speak it! Tom!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God! When a helpless girl&#8211;when a &#8211;!&#8221;
He choked, beside himself with rage.</p>

<p>She sprang to him, and caught his sleeve in a
convulsive grasp. &#8220;Hush, for mercy&#8217;s sake!
Tom Blake, remember&#8211;you&#8217;re a man!&#8221;</p>

<p>He calmed like a ferocious dog at the voice
of its master; but it was several minutes before
he could bring himself to obey her insistent
urging that he should return to the injured
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; he at last growled. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t do
it even for you, but he&#8217;s good as dead&#8211;lucky
for him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dying. . . . . You stay away.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went around the baobab and a few paces
along the cleft to the place where a limp form
lay huddled on the ledges, out of the mud.
Slowly, as though drawn by the fascination of
horror, the girl crept after him. When she saw
the broken, storm-beaten thing that had been
Winthrope, she stopped, and would have turned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>
back. After all, as Blake had said, he was
dying&#8211;</p>

<p>When she stood at the feet of the writhing
figure, and looked down into the battered face,
it required all her will-power to keep from fainting.
Blake frowned up at her for an instant, but
said nothing.</p>

<p>Winthrope was speaking, feebly and brokenly,
yet distinctly: &#8220;Really, I did not mean any
harm&#8211;at first&#8211;you know. But a man does
not always have control&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a beast like you!&#8221; growled Blake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ow! Don&#8217;t &#8217;it me! I say now, I&#8217;m done
for! My legs are cold already&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, quick, Mr. Blake! build a fire! It may
be, some hot broth&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too late,&#8221; muttered Blake. &#8220;See here, Winthrope,
there&#8217;s no use lying about it. You&#8217;re going
out mighty soon. See if you can&#8217;t die like a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Die! . . . Gawd, but I can&#8217;t die&#8211;I can&#8217;t
die&#8211;Ow! it burns!&#8221;</p>

<p>He flung up a hand, and sought to tear at his
wounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold hard!&#8221; cried Blake, catching the hand
in an iron grip.</p>

<p>Something in his touch, or the tone of command,
seemed to cower the wretched man into a
state of abject submission.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>&#8220;S&#8217;elp me, I&#8217;ll confess!&#8211;I&#8217;ll confess all!&#8221;
he babbled. &#8220;The stones are sewed in the
stomach pad; I &#8217;ad to take &#8217;em hout of their settings,
and melt up the gold.&#8221; He paused, and a
cunning smile stole over his distorted features.
&#8220;Ho, wot a bloomin&#8217; lark! Valet plays the gent,
an&#8217; they never &#8217;as a hinkling! Mr. Cecil Winthrope,
hif you please, an&#8217; a &#8217;int of a title&#8211;wot
a lark! &#8217;Awkings, me lad, you&#8217;re a gay &#8217;oaxer!
Wot a lark! wot a lark!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again there was a pause. The breath of the
wounded man came in labored gasps. There
was an ominous rattling in his throat. Yet once
again he rallied, and this time his eyes turned to
Miss Leslie, bright with an agonized consciousness
of her presence and of all his guilt and
shame.</p>

<p>His voice shrilled out in quavering appeal:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t&#8211;don&#8217;t look at me, miss! I tried to
make myself a gentleman; God knows I tried!
I fought my way up out of the East End&#8211;out
of that hell&#8211;and none ever lifted finger to help
me. I educated myself like a scholar&#8211;then the
stock sharks cheated me of my savings&#8211;out of
the last penny; and I had to take service. My
God! a valet&#8211;his Grace&#8217;s valet, and I a
scholar! Do you wonder the devil got into me?
Do you&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>Blake&#8217;s deep voice, firm but strangely husky,
broke in upon and silenced the cry of agony:
&#8220;There, I guess you&#8217;ve said enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough!&#8211;and last night&#8211;My God! to be
such a beast! The devil tempted me&#8211;aye, and
he&#8217;s paid me out in my own coin! I&#8217;m done for!
God ha&#8217; mercy on me!&#8211;God ha&#8217; mercy&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Again came the gasping rattle; this time there
was no rally.</p>

<p>Blake thrust himself between Miss Leslie and
the crumpled figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get back around the tree,&#8221; he said harshly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my business,&#8221; he replied. He thrust
his burning-glass into her hand. &#8220;Here; go
and build a fire, if you can find any dry stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to&#8211; You&#8217;ll bury him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Whatever he may have been, he&#8217;s dead
now, poor devil!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go,&#8221; she half whispered, &#8220;not until&#8211;until
I&#8217;ve learned&#8211; Do you&#8211;can you tell me
just what is paranoia?&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake studied a little, and tapped the top of
his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Near as I can say, it&#8217;s softening of the brain.&#8211;up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that&#8211;&#8221; she hesitated&#8211;&#8220;that
he had it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>Again Blake paused to consider.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m no alienist. I thought him a softy
from the first. But that was all in line with what
he was playing on us&#8211;British dude. Fooled
me, and I&#8217;d been chumming with Jimmy Scarbridge,&#8211;and
Jimmy was the straight goods,
fresh imported&#8211;monocle even&#8211;when I first
ran up against him. No; this&#8211;this Hawkins,
if that&#8217;s his name, had brains all right. Still,
he may have been cracked. When folks go
dotty, they sometimes get extra &#8217;cute. The best
I can think of him is that losing his savings may
have made him slip a cog, and then the scare
over the way we landed here and his spells of
fever probably hurried up the softening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you believe his story?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do. But if you&#8217;ll go, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing more&#8211;I must know now! Do
you remember the day when you set up the
signal, and you&#8211;you quarrelled with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake reddened, and dropped his gaze. &#8220;Did
he go and tell you that? The sneak!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you please, let us say nothing more about
him. But would you care to tell me what you
meant&#8211;what you said then?&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake&#8217;s flush deepened; but he raised his head,
and faced her squarely as he answered: &#8220;No;
I&#8217;m not going to repeat any dead man&#8217;s talk;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>
and as for what I said, this isn&#8217;t the time or
place to say anything in that line&#8211;now that
we&#8217;re alone. Understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I do not, Mr. Blake. Please
explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me, Miss Jenny. I can&#8217;t tell you
now. You&#8217;ll have to wait till we get aboard
ship. We&#8217;ll catch a steamer before long. &#8217;T isn&#8217;t
every one of them that goes ashore in these
blows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you build that door? Did you
suspect&#8211;&#8221; She glanced down at the huddled
figure between them.</p>

<p>Blake frowned and hesitated; then burst out
almost angrily: &#8220;Well, you know now he was a
sneak; so it&#8217;s not blabbing to tell that much&#8211;I
knew he was before; and it&#8217;s never safe to trust
a sneak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; she said, and she turned away
quickly that she might not again look at the
prostrate figure.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>WRECKAGE AND SALVAGE</span></h2>

<p>All the wood in the cleft was sodden from
the fierce downpour that had accompanied
the cyclone; all the cleft bottom
other than the bare ledges was a bed of mud;
everything without the tree-cave had been either
blown away or heaped with broken boughs and
mud-spattered rubbish. But the girl had far too
much to think about to feel any concern over the
mere damage and destruction of things. It was
rather a relief to find something that called for
work.</p>

<p>Not being able to find dry fuel, she gathered a
quantity of the least sodden of the twigs and
branches, and spread them out on a ledge in the
clear sunshine. While her firewood was drying,
she scraped away the mud and litter heaped upon
her rude hearth. She then began a search for
lost articles. When she dug out the pottery ware,
she found her favorite stew-pot and one of the
platters in fragments. The drying-frames for
the meat had been blown away, and so had the
antelope and hyena skins.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>Catching sight of a bit of white down among
the bamboos, she went to it, and was not a little
surprised to see the tattered remnant of her duck
skirt. It had evidently been torn from the signal
staff by the first gust of the cyclone, whirled
down into the cleft by some flaw or eddy in the
wind, and wadded so tightly into the heart of the
thick clump of stems that all the fury of the storm
had failed to dislodge it. Its recovery seemed to
the girl a special providence; for of course they
must keep up a signal on the cliff.</p>

<p>Having started her fire and set on a stew, she
hunted out her sewing materials from their crevice
in the cave, and began mending the slits in
the torn flag. While she worked she sat on a
shaded ledge, her bare feet toasting in the sun,
and her soggy, mud-smeared moccasins drying
within reach. When Blake appeared, the moccasins
were still where she had first set them;
but the little pink feet were safely tucked up beneath
the tattered flag. Fortunately, the sight of
the white cloth prevented Blake from noticing
the moccasins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8211;the
flag? Say, that&#8217;s luck! I&#8217;ll break out a bamboo
right off. Old staff&#8217;s carried clean away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Blake,&#8211;just a moment, please. What
have you done with&#8211;with it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>Blake jerked his thumb upward.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have carried him up on the cliff?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Best place I could think of. No animals&#8211;and
I piled stones over.... But, I say, look
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew out a piece of wadded cloth, marked
off into little squares by crossing lines of stitches.
One of the squares near the edge had been ripped
open. Blake thrust in his finger, and worked out
an emerald the size of a large pea.</p>

<p>&#8220;O-h-h!&#8221; cried Miss Leslie, as he held the
glittering gem out to her in his rough palm.</p>

<p>He drew it back, and carefully thrust it again
into its pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s another in
every square of this innocent, harmless rag&#8211;dozens
of them. He must have made a clean
sweep of the duke&#8217;s&#8211;or, more like, the duchess&#8217;s
jewels. Now, if you please, I want you to sew
this up tight again, and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot&#8211;I cannot touch it!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, I didn&#8217;t mean to&#8211; It was confounded
stupid of me,&#8221; mumbled Blake. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you
excuse me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course! It was only the&#8211;the thought
that&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No wonder. I always am a fool when it
comes to ladies. I&#8217;ll fix the thing all right.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>Catching up the nearest small pot, he crammed
the quilted cloth down within it, and filled it to
the brim with sticky mud.</p>

<p>&#8220;There! Guess nobody&#8217;s going to run off
with a jug of mud&#8211;and it won&#8217;t hurt the stones
till we get a chance to look up the owner. He
won&#8217;t be hard to find&#8211;English duke minus a
pint of first-class sparklers! Will you mind its
setting in the cave after things are fixed up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; not as it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded soberly. &#8220;All right, then. Now
I&#8217;ll go for the new flag-staff. You might set out
breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded in turn, and when he came back
from the bamboos with the largest of the great
canes on his shoulder, his breakfast was waiting
for him. She set it before him, and turned to go
again to her sewing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This won&#8217;t do. You&#8217;ve
got to eat your share.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not&#8211;I am not hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no matter. Here!&#8221;</p>

<p>He forced upon her a bowl of hot broth, and
she drank it because she could not resist his
rough kindness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! Now a piece of meat,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Mr. Blake!&#8221; she protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you must!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>She took a bite, and sought to eat; but there
was such a lump in her throat that she could not
swallow. The tears gushed into her eyes, and
she began to weep.</p>

<p>Blake&#8217;s close-set lips relaxed, and he nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it; let it run out. You&#8217;re overwrought.
There&#8217;s nothing like a good cry to
ease off a woman&#8217;s nerves&#8211;and I guess ladies
aren&#8217;t much different from women when it comes
to such things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8211;I want to get the flag mended!&#8221; she
sobbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, all right; plenty of time!&#8221; he
soothed. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to see how things look
down the cleft.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bolted the last of his meat, and at once
left her alone to cry herself back to calmness
over the stitching of the signal.</p>

<p>His first concern was for the barricade. As he
had feared, he found that it had been blown to
pieces. The greater part of the thorn branches
which he had gathered with so much labor were
scattered to the four corners of the earth. He
stood staring at the wreckage in glum silence;
but he did not swear, as he would have done the
week before. Presently his face cleared, and he
began to whistle in a plaintive minor key. He
was thinking of how she had looked when she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
darted out of the tree at his call&#8211;of her concern
for him. When he was so angered at Winthrope,
she had called him Tom!</p>

<p>After a time he started on, picking his way
over the remnant of the barricade, without a
falter in his whistling. The deluge of rain had
poured down the cleft in a torrent, tearing away
the root-matted soil and laying bare the ledges in
the channel of the spring rill. But aside from an
occasional boggy hole, the water had drained away.</p>

<p>At the foot, about the swollen pool, was a wide
stretch of rubbish and mud. He worked his way
around the edge, and came out on the plain,
where the sandy soil was all the firmer for its
drenching. He swung away at a lively clip.
The air was fresh and pure after the storm, and
a slight breeze tempered the sun-rays.</p>

<p>He kept on along the cliff until he turned the
point. It was not altogether advisable to bathe
at this time of day; but he had been caught out
by the cyclone in a corner of the swamp, across
the river, where the soil was of clay. Only his
anxiety for Miss Leslie had enabled him to fight
his way out of the all but impassable morass
which the storm deluge had made of the half-dry
swamp. At dawn he had reached the river, and
swam across, reckless of the crocodiles. The
turbid water of the stream had rid him of only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>
part of his accumulated slime and ooze. So now
he washed out his tattered garments as well as
he could without soap, and while they were drying
on the sun-scorched rocks, swam about in
the clear, tonic sea-water, quite as reckless of the
sharks as he had been of the ugly crocodiles in
the river.</p>

<p>For all this, he was back at the baobab before
Miss Leslie had stitched up the last slit in the
torn flag.</p>

<p>She looked up at him, with a brave attempt at
a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I&#8217;m not much of a needle-woman,&#8221;
she sighed. &#8220;Look at those stitches!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fret. They&#8217;ll hold all right, and
that&#8217;s what we want,&#8221; he reassured her. &#8220;Give
it me, now. I&#8217;ve got to get it up, and hurry
back for a nap. No sleep last night&#8211;I was out
beyond the river, in the swamp&#8211;and to-night I&#8217;ll
have to go on watch. The barricade is down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that is too bad! Couldn&#8217;t I take a turn
on watch?&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake shook his head. &#8220;No; I&#8217;ll sleep to-day,
and work rebuilding the barricade to-night.
Toward morning I might build up the fire, and
take a nap.&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught up the flag and its new staff, and
swung away through the cleft.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>He returned much sooner than Miss Leslie expected,
and at once began to throw up a small
lean-to of bamboos over a ledge at the cliff foot,
behind the baobab. The girl thought he was
making himself a hut, in place of the canopy
under which he had slept before the storm, which,
like Winthrope&#8217;s, had been carried away. But
when he stopped work, he laconically informed
her that all she had to do to complete her new
house was to dry some leaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I thought it was for yourself!&#8221; she protested.
&#8220;I will sleep inside the tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doc Blake says no!&#8221; he rejoined&#8211;&#8220;not till
it&#8217;s dried out.&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced at his face, and replied, without
a moment&#8217;s hesitancy: &#8220;Very well. I will do
what you think best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; he said, and went at once to
lie down for his much needed sleep.</p>

<p>He awoke just soon enough before dark to
see the results of her hard day&#8217;s labor. All the
provisions stored in the tree had been brought
out to dry, and a great stack of fuel, ready for
burning, was piled up against the baobab; while
all about the tree the rubbish had been neatly
gathered together in heaps. Blake looked his admiration
for her industry. But then his forehead
wrinkled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>&#8220;You oughtn&#8217;t to&#8217;ve done so much,&#8221; he admonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you I can tote fair!&#8221; she rejoined.
During the afternoon she had called to mind that
odd expression of a Southern girl chum, and
had been waiting her opportunity to banter him
with it.</p>

<p>He stared at her open-eyed, and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Miss Jenny, you&#8217;d better look out.
You&#8217;ll be speaking American, first thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon, they fell to chattering like children
out of school, each happy to be able to forget for
the moment that broken figure up on the cliff top
and the haunting fear of what another day might
bring to them.</p>

<p>When they had eaten their meal, both with keen
appetites, Blake sprang up, with a curt &#8220;Good-night!&#8221;
and swung off down the cleft. The girl
looked after him, with a lingering smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish he hadn&#8217;t rushed off so suddenly,&#8221;
she murmured. &#8220;I was just going to thank him
for&#8211;for everything!&#8221;</p>

<p>The color swept over her face in a deep blush,
and she darted around to her tiny hut as though
some one might have overheard her whisper.</p>

<p>Yet, after all, she had said nothing; or, at
least, she had merely said &#8220;everything.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class='h2fs'>UNDERSTANDING AND MISUNDERSTANDING</span></h2>

<p>In the morning she found Blake scraping
energetically at the inner surfaces of a pair
of raw hyena skins.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve killed more game!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Game? No; hyenas. I hated to waste
good poison on the brutes; but nothing else
showed up, and I need a new pair of pa&#8211;er&#8211;trousers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it not dangerous&#8211;great beasts like
these!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even enough to make it interesting. I&#8217;d
have had some fun, though, with that confounded
lion when the moon came up, if he hadn&#8217;t
sneaked off into the grass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A lion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Didn&#8217;t you hear him? The skulking
brute prowled around for hours before the
moon rose, when it was pitch dark. It was
mighty lonesome, with him yowling down by
the pool. Half a chance, and I&#8217;d given him
something to yowl about. But it wasn&#8217;t any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>
use firing off my arrows in the dark, and, as I
said, he sneaked off before&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom&#8211;Mr. Blake!&#8211;you must not risk your
life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry about me. I&#8217;ve learned how
to look out for Tom Blake. And you can just
bank on it I&#8217;m going to look out for Miss Jenny
Leslie, too! . . . . But say, after breakfast, suppose
we take a run out on the cliffs for eggs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not wish any to-day, thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited a little, studying her down-bent
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he muttered; &#8220;you don&#8217;t have to
come. I know I oughtn&#8217;t to take a moment&#8217;s
time. I did quite a bit last night; but if you
think&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced up, puzzled. His meaning flashed
upon her, and she rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, not that! I will come,&#8221; she answered,
and hastened to prepare the morning meal.</p>

<p>When they came to the tree-ladder, she found
that the heap of stones built up by Blake to
facilitate the first part of the ascent was now
so high that she could climb into the branches
without difficulty. She surmised that Blake had
found it necessary to build up the pile before he
could ascend with his burden.</p>

<p>They were at the foot of the heap, when, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
a sharp exclamation, Blake sprang up into the
branches, and scrambled to the top in hot haste.
Wondering what this might mean, Miss Leslie
followed as fast as she could. When she reached
the top, she saw him running across towards an
out-jutting point on the north edge of the cliff.</p>

<p>She had hurried after him for more than half
the distance before she perceived the vultures
that were gathered in a solemn circle about a
long and narrow heap of stones, on a ledge, down
on the sloping brink of the cliff. While at the
foot of the tree Blake had seen one of the grewsome
flock descending to join the others, and,
fearful of what might be happening, had rushed
on ahead.</p>

<p>At his approach, the croaking watchers hopped
awkwardly from the ledges, and soared away;
only to wheel, and circle back overhead. Miss
Leslie shrank down, shuddering. Blake came
back near her, and began to gather up the pieces
of loose rock which were strewn about beneath
the ledges on that part of the cliff.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I piled up enough,&#8221; he explained, in
response to her look. &#8220;All the same, a few
more will do no harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are sure those awful birds have
not&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>He carried an armful of rocks to lay on the
mound. When he began to gather more, she
followed his example. They worked in silence,
piling the rough stones gently one upon another,
until the cairn had grown to twice its former size.
The air on the open cliff top was fresher than in
the cleft, and Miss Leslie gave little heed to the
absence of shade. She would have worked on
under the burning sun without thought of consequences.
But Blake knew the need of moderation.</p>

<p>&#8220;There; that&#8217;ll do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He may have
been&#8211;all he was; but we&#8217;ve no more than
done our duty. Now, we&#8217;ll stroll out on the
point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should prefer to return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt. But it&#8217;s time you learned how to
go nesting. What if you should be left alone
here? Besides, it looks to me like the signal is
tearing loose.&#8221;</p>

<p>She accompanied him out along the cliff crest
until they stood in the midst of the bird colony,
half deafened by their harsh clamor. She had
never ventured into their concourse when alone.
Even now she cried out, and would have retreated
before the sharp bills and beating wings
had not Blake walked ahead and kicked the
squawking birds out of the path. Having made
certain that the big white flag was still secure on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>
its staff, he led the way along the seaward brink
of the cliff, pointing out the different kinds of
seafowl, and shouting information about such of
their habits and qualities as were of concern to
hungry castaways.</p>

<p>He concluded the lesson by descending a dizzy
flight of ledges to rob the nest of a frigate bird.
It was a foolhardy feat at best, and doubly so in
view of the thousands of eggs lying all around
in the hollows of the cliff top. But from these
Blake had recently culled out all the fresh settings
of the frigate birds, and none of the other
eggs equalled them in delicacy of flavor.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; he demanded, as he drew
himself up over the edge of the cliff, and handed
the big chalky-white egg into her keeping.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather go without than see you take
such risks,&#8221; she replied coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would, eh!&#8221; he cried, quite misunderstanding
her, and angered by what seemed to him
a gratuitous rebuff. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;d rather you&#8217;d
say nothing than speak in that tone. If you
don&#8217;t want the egg heave it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unable to conceive any cause for his sudden
anger, she was alarmed, and drew back, watching
him with sidelong glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Think
I&#8217;m going to bite you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>She shrank farther away, and did not answer.
He stared at her, his eyes hard and bright. Suddenly
he burst into a harsh laugh, and strode
away towards the cliff, savagely kicking aside
the birds that came in his path.</p>

<p>When, an hour later, the girl crept back along
the cleft to the baobab, she saw him hard at work
building a little hut, several yards down towards
the barricade. The moment she perceived what
he was about her bearing became less guarded,
and she took up her own work with a spirit and
energy which she had not shown since the adventure
with the puff adder.</p>

<p>At her call to the noon meal, Blake took his
time to respond, and when he at last came to
join her, he was morose and taciturn. She met
him with a smile, and exerted all her womanly
tact to conciliate him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must help me eat the egg,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve boiled it hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather eat beef,&#8221; he mumbled.</p>

<p>&#8220;But just to please me&#8211;when I&#8217;ve cooked
it your way!&#8221;</p>

<p>He uttered an inarticulate sound which she
chose to interpret as assent. The egg was already
shelled. She cut it exactly in half, and
served one of the pieces to him with a bit of
warm fat and a pinch of salt. As he took the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
dish, he raised his sullen eyes to her face. She
met his gaze with a look of smiling insistence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come now,&#8221; she said; &#8220;please don&#8217;t refuse.
I&#8217;m sorry I was so rude.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you feel that way about it!&#8211;not that
I care for fancy dishes,&#8221; he responded gruffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be missing half the enjoyment to
eat such a delicacy without some one to share
it,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Blake looked away without answer. But she
could see that his face was beginning to clear.
Greatly encouraged, she chatted away as though
they were seated at her father&#8217;s dinner-table, and
he was an elderly friend from the business world
whom it was her duty to entertain.</p>

<p>For a while Blake betrayed little interest,
confining himself to monosyllables except when
he commented on the care with which she had
cooked the various dishes. When she least expected,
he looked up at her, his lips parted in a
broad smile. She stopped short, for she had been
describing her first social triumphs, and his untimely
levity embarrassed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get mad, Miss Jenny,&#8221; he said, his eyes
twinkling. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know how funny it
seems to sit here and listen to you talking about
those things. It&#8217;s like serving up ice cream and
onions in the same dish.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure, Mr. Blake&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beats a burlesque all hollow&#8211;Mrs. Sint-Regis-Waldoff&#8217;s
chop-sooey tea and young Mrs.
Vandam-Jones&#8217;s auto-cotillon&#8211;with us sitting
here like troglodytes, chewing snake-poisoned
antelope, and you in that Kundry dress&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you&#8211;I was not aware that you knew
about music.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know a note. But give me a chance
to hear good music, and I&#8217;m there, if I have to
stand in the peanut gallery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad! I&#8217;m very, very fond of
music! Have you been to Bayreuth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Germany. It is where his operas are
given as staged by Wagner himself. It is indescribably
grand and inspiring&#8211;above all, the
Parsifal!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll most certainly take that in, even if I have
to cut short my engagement in this gee-lorious
clime&#8211;not but what, when it comes to leopard
ladies&#8211;&#8221; He paused, and surveyed her with
frank admiration.</p>

<p>The blood leaped into her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she gasped, &#8220;I never dreamed that
even such a man as you would compare me with&#8211;with a creature like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a man as me!&#8221; repeated Blake, staring.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>
&#8220;What do you mean? I know I&#8217;m not much
of a ladies&#8217; man; but to be yanked up like this
when a fellow is trying to pay a compliment&#8211;well,
it&#8217;s not just what you&#8217;d call pleasant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, Mr. Blake. I misunderstood.
I&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Miss Jenny! I don&#8217;t ask
any lady to beg my pardon. The only thing
is I don&#8217;t see why you should flare out at me
that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a full minute she sat, with down-bent head,
her face clouded with doubt and indecision. At
last she bravely raised her eyes to meet his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you wonder that I am not quite myself?&#8221;
she asked. &#8220;You should remember that I have
always had the utmost comforts of life, and have
been cared for&#8211; Don&#8217;t you see how terrible it is
for me? And then the death of&#8211;of&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t be sorry for that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But even you felt how terrible it was . . . .
and then&#8211;Oh, surely, you must see how&#8211;how
embarrassing&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Blake&#8217;s turn to look down and hesitate.
She studied his face, her bosom heaving with
quick-drawn breath; but she could make nothing
of his square jaw and firm-set lips. His eyes
were concealed by the brim of his leaf hat.
When he spoke, seemingly it was to change the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>
subject: &#8220;Guess you saw me making my hut.
I&#8217;m fixing it so it&#8217;ll do me even when it rains.&#8221;</p>

<p>Had he been the kind of man that she had
been educated to consider as alone entitled to the
name of gentleman, she could have felt certain
that he had intended the remark for a delicately
worded assurance. But was Tom Blake, for all
his blunt kindliness, capable of such tact? She
chose to consider that he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a cunning little bungalow. But will not
the rain flood you out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to have a raised floor. You&#8217;re
more like to have the rain drive in on you again.
I&#8217;ll have to rig up a porch over your door. It
won&#8217;t do to stuff up the hole. You&#8217;ve little
enough air as it is. But that can wait a while.
There&#8217;s other work more pressing. First, there&#8217;s
the barricade. By the time that&#8217;s done, those
hyena skins will be cured enough to use. I&#8217;ve
got to have new trousers soon, and new shoes,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do the sewing, if you will cut out the
pattern.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I&#8217;ll take a stagger at it myself first.
I&#8217;d rather you&#8217;d go egging. You need to run
around more, to keep in trim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel quite well now, and I am growing so
strong! The only thing is this constant heat.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to grin and bear it. After all,
it&#8217;s not so bad, if only we can stave off the fever.
Another reason I want you to go for eggs is that
you can take your time about it, and keep a
look-out for steamers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you think &#8211;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t screw up your hopes too high. We&#8217;ve
little show of being picked up by a chance boat
on a coast with reefs like this. But I figure that if
I was in your daddy&#8217;s shoes, it&#8217;d be high time for
me to be cabling a ship to run up from Natal, or
down from Zanzibar, to look around for jettison,
et cetera.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure papa will offer a big reward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Second the motion! I&#8217;ve a sort of idea I
wouldn&#8217;t mind coming in for a reward myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You? Oh, yes; to be sure. Papa is generous,
and he will be grateful to any one who&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think I mean his dirty money!&#8221; broke
in Blake, hotly.</p>

<p>Her confusion told him that he had not been
mistaken. His face, only a moment since bright
and pleasant, took on its sullenest frown.</p>

<p>Miss Leslie rose hurriedly, and started along
the cleft.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he called. &#8220;Not going for eggs now,
are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not reply.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>&#8220;Hang it all, Miss Jenny! Don&#8217;t go off like
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask you to excuse me, Mr. Blake? Is
that sufficient?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sufficient? It&#8217;s enough to give a fellow a
chill! Come now; don&#8217;t go off mad. You know
I&#8217;ve a quick temper. Can&#8217;t you make allowances?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve&#8211;you&#8217;ve no right to look so angry,
even if I did misunderstand you. You misunderstood
me!&#8221; She caught herself up with a half
sob. His silence gave her time to recover her
composure. She continued with excessive politeness,
&#8220;Need I repeat my request to be excused,
Mr. Blake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; once is enough! But honest now, I
didn&#8217;t mean to be nasty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-day, Mr. Blake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, da-darn it, good-day!&#8221; he groaned.</p>

<p>When, a few minutes later, she returned, he
was gone. He did not come back until some
time after dark, when she had withdrawn to her
lean-to for the night. His hands were bleeding
from thorn scratches; but after a hasty supper,
he went back down the cleft to build up the new
wall of the barricade with the great stack of fresh
thorn-brush that he had gathered during the
afternoon.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span><a id='link_23'></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE END OF THE WORLD</span></h2>

<p>In the morning he met Miss Leslie with a sullen
bearing, which, however, did not altogether
conceal his desire to be on friendly terms.
Having regained her self-control, she responded
to this with such tact that by evening each felt
more at ease in the new relationship, and Blake
had lost every trace of his moroseness. The fact
that both were passionately fond of music proved
an immense help. It gave them an impersonal
source of mutual sympathy and understanding,&#8211;a
common meeting-ground in the world of art and
culture, apart from and above the plane of their
material wants.</p>

<p>Yet for all his enjoyment of the girl&#8217;s wide
knowledge of everything relating to music, Blake
took care that their talks and discussions did not
interfere with the activities of their primitive mode
of life. As soon as he had finished with the barricade,
he devoted himself to his tailoring and
shoe-making; while Miss Leslie, between her
cooking and wood-gathering and daily visits to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
the cliff for eggs, had much to occupy both her
thoughts and her hands.</p>

<p>At first every ascent of the cliff was embittered
by a painful consciousness of the cairn upon the
north edge. Fortunately it was not in sight from
the direct path to the headland, and, as she refrained
from visiting it, the new happenings of
her wild life soon thrust Winthrope and his death
out of the foreground of her thoughts. Each day
she had to nerve herself to meet the beaks and
wings of the despoiled nest-owners; each day she
looked with greater hope for the expected rescue
ship, only to be increasingly disappointed.</p>

<p>But the hours she spent on the cliff crest after
gathering the day&#8217;s supply of eggs were not spent
merely in watching and longing. The inconvenience
of carrying the eggs in a handkerchief or in
one of the heavy jars suggested a renewal of her
attempt at basket-making. Memory, perseverance,
and a trace of inventiveness enabled her to produce
a small but serviceable hamper of split
bamboo.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this success she gathered a
quantity of tough, wiry grass, and wove a hat to
take the place of the flimsy palm-leaf makeshift.
The result was by no means satisfactory with
regard to style, its shape being intermediate between
a Mexican sombrero and a funnel; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
aside from its appearance, she could not have
wished for a more comfortable head-cover. Before
showing it to Blake, she wove a second one for
him, so that they were able to cast aside the grotesque,
palm-leaf affairs at the same time.</p>

<p>The following morning Blake appeared in an
outfit to match her leopard-skin dress. He had
singed off the hair of the hide out of which he
had made his moccasins, and his hyena-skin
trousers quite matched the bristling stubble on
his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Miss Jenny!&#8221; he hailed; &#8220;what d&#8217;
you think of this for fancy needlework?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendid! You&#8217;re the very picture of an
Argentine vaquero.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Greaser?&#8211;ugh! Let me get back to the
Weary Willy pants!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean you are very picturesque.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, is it? Glad I&#8217;ve got something to
call your leopardine gown that won&#8217;t make you
huffy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can at least call our costumes serviceable,
and mine has proved much cooler than I expected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But our new hats beat all for that&#8211;regular
sunshades. What do you say?&#8211;there&#8217;s a good
breeze&#8211; Let&#8217;s take a hike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to the river! The very thought of that
dreadful snake&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>&#8220;No; just the other way. I&#8217;ve been thinking
for some time that we ought to run down to that
south headland, and take a squint at the coast
beyond. Ten to one, it&#8217;s another stretch of
swamps, but&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think there is a chance we may find a
town?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About one chance in a million, even for a
native village. The slave trade wiped the niggers
off this coast, and I guess those that hit out upcountry
ran so hard they haven&#8217;t been able to
get back yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it has been years since the slave trade
was forbidden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they don&#8217;t sell beer in Kansas&#8211;oh, no!
I&#8217;ll bet the dhows still slip over from Madagascar
when the moon is in the right quarter. At any
rate, niggers are mighty scarce or mighty shy
around here. I&#8217;ve kept a watch for smoke, and
haven&#8217;t seen a suspicion of it anywhere. Maybe
the swamps swing around inland and cut off this
strip of coast. It looked that way to me when I
made that trip along the ridge. But there&#8217;s a
chance it used to be inhabited, and we may run
across an abandoned village.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not see that the discovery would do us
any good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the chance of grain or bananas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>
still growing? But that&#8217;s all a guess. We&#8217;re
going because we need a change.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded, and hastened to prepare breakfast,
while he packed a skin bag with food, and examined
the slender tips of his arrows. As a
matter of precaution, he had been keeping them
in the cigarette case, where the points would be
certain of a coat of the sticky poison and at the
same time guarded against inflicting a chance
wound. But as he was now about to set out on
a journey, he fitted tips into the heads of his two
straightest shafts.</p>

<p>The morning was still fresh when they closed
the barricade behind them and descended to
the pool. There was no game in sight, but
Blake had no wish to hunt at the commencement
of the trip. The steady southwest wind
had blown the sky clear of its malarial haze,
and gave promise of a day which should know
nothing of sultry calm&#8211;a day on which game
would be hard to stalk, but one perfectly suited
for a long tramp.</p>

<p>Mindful of ticks, Blake headed obliquely across
to the beach. Once on the smooth, hard sand,
they swung along at a brisk pace, light-hearted
and keen with the spirit of adventure. Never
had they felt more companionable. Miss Leslie
laughed and chatted and sang snatches of songs,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
while Blake beat time with his club, or sought to
whistle grand opera&#8211;he had healed his blistered
lips some time before by liberal applications
of antelope tallow.</p>

<p>Gulls and terns circled about them, or hovered
over the water, ready to swoop down upon their
finny prey. Sandpipers ran along the beach
within a stone&#8217;s throw, but the curlews showed
their greater knowledge of mankind by keeping
beyond gunshot.</p>

<p>Once a great flock of geese drove high overhead,
their leader honking the alarm as they
swept above the suspicious figures on the beach.
Like the curlews, they had knowledge of mankind.
But the flock of white pelicans which came
sailing along in stately leisure on their immense
wings floated past so low that Blake felt certain
he could shoot one. He raised his bow and
took aim, but refrained from shooting, at the
thought that it might be a sheer waste of his
precious poison.</p>

<p>A little later a herd of large animals appeared
on the border of the grass jungle, but wheeled
and dashed back into cover so quickly that Blake
barely had time to make out that they were buffaloes&#8211;the
first he had seen on this coast, but
easily recognized by their resemblance to the
Cape variety. Their flight gave him small
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
concern; for the time being he was more interested
in topography than game.</p>

<p>The southern headland now lay close before
them, its seaward face rearing up sheer and lofty,
but the approach behind running down in broken
terraces. Mid-morning found the explorers at
the foot of the ridge. Blake squinted up at the
boulder-strewn slopes and the crannies of the
broken ledges.</p>

<p>&#8220;Likely place for snakes, Miss Jenny,&#8221; he
remarked. &#8220;Guess I&#8217;d better lead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eager as she was to look over into the country
beyond, the girl dropped into second place, and
made no complaint about the wary slowness of
her companion&#8217;s advance. She found the most
difficult parts of the ascent quite easy after her
training on the tree-ladder. Blake could have
taken ledges and all at a run, but as he mounted
each terrace, he halted to spy out the ground
before him. Like Miss Leslie, he was looking for
snakes, though for an exactly opposite reason.
He wished to add to the contents of the cigarette
case.</p>

<p>Greatly to his disappointment and the girl&#8217;s relief,
neither snake nor sign of snake was to be seen
all the way up the ridge. As they neared the
crest Blake turned to offer her his hand up the
last ledges, and in the instant they gained the top.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>The wind, now freshening to a gale, struck the
girl with such force that she would have been
blown back down the ledges had not Blake
clutched her wrist. Heedless alike of the painful
grip which held her and of the gusts which tore
at her skirt, the girl stood gazing out across the
desolate swamps which stretched away to the
southwest as far as the eye could see. She did
not speak until Blake led her down behind the
shelter of the crest ledges.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t
I warn you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked away to hide the tears which sprang
into her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t explain&#8211;only, it makes me feel so&#8211;so
lonely!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come now, little woman; don&#8217;t take on
so!&#8221; he urged. &#8220;It might be a lot worse, you
know. We&#8217;ve gotten along pretty well, considering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been very kind, Mr. Blake, and as
you say, matters might have been worse. I do
not forget how far more terrible was our situation
the morning after the storm. Yet you must
realize how disappointing it is to lose even the
slightest hope of escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know. If it wasn&#8217;t for the
fever that&#8217;s bound to come with the rains, I, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
one, would just as leave stick to this camp right
along, providing the company don&#8217;t change.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned upon him with flashing eyes, all
thought of caution lost in her anger. &#8220;How
dare you say such a thing? You are contemptible!
I despise you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My, Miss Jenny, but you are pretty when
you get mad!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The answer took her completely aback. He
was neither angry nor laughing at her, but met
her defiant glance with candid, sober admiration.
There was something more than admiration in
his glowing eyes; yet she could not but see that
her alarm had been baseless. His manner had
never been more respectful. Suddenly she found
that she could no longer meet his gaze. She
looked away and stammered lamely, &#8220;You&#8211;you
shouldn&#8217;t say such things, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? Hasn&#8217;t everything been running
smooth the last few days? Haven&#8217;t we been
good chummy comrades? Of course you&#8217;ve got
the worst of the deal. I know I&#8217;m not much on
fancy talk; but I like to hear it when I&#8217;ve a
chance. I&#8217;ve led a lonesome sort of life since
they did for my sisters&#8211; No; I&#8217;m not going
to rake that up again. I&#8217;m only trying to give
you an idea what it means to a fellow to be with
a lady like you. May be it isn&#8217;t polite to tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>
you all this, but it&#8217;s just what I feel, and I never
did amount to shucks as a liar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I understand you, Mr. Blake, and I
really feel highly complimented.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t, any such thing, Miss Jenny.
Own up, now! If I met you to-morrow on your
papa&#8217;s doorstep, you&#8217;d cut me cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should if you continued to be so rude.
Have you no regard for my feelings? But here
we are, talking nonsense, when we should be
going&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it nonsense?&#8221; he broke in. &#8220;What does
life mean, anyway? Here we can be true
friends and comrades,&#8211;real, free living people.
It can&#8217;t be that you want to go back to all those
society shams, after you&#8217;ve seen real life! As
for me, what have I to gain by going back to
the everlasting grind? I don&#8217;t mind work; but
when a man has nothing ahead to work for but a
bank account, when it&#8217;s grind, grind, grind till
your head goes stale and all the world looks
black, then there&#8217;s no choice but throw up your
job and go on a drunk, if you want to keep from
a gun accident. Maybe you don&#8217;t understand it.
But that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve had to go through, time
and again. Do you wonder I like to fancy an
everlasting picnic here, with a little partner who
wouldn&#8217;t let me come within shouting distance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
of her in the land of lavender&#8211;trousers and
peek-a-boos?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Blake, really you are most unjust! I
could not be so&#8211;so ungrateful, after all your
kindness. I&#8211;we should certainly be glad to
number you among our friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Drink and all, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man of your will-power has no need
whatever to give way to such a habit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Course not, if he&#8217;s got anything in sight
worth while. Guess, though, my folks must
have been poor white trash. I never could go
after money just for the fun of the game. No
family, no friends, no&#8211;what-you -call-it?&#8211;culture&#8211;
What&#8217;s the use? I have a fair
head for figures; but all the mathematics that
I know I&#8217;ve had to catch hot off the bat. It&#8217;s
true I grubbed my C. E. out of a correspondence
school; but a fellow has to have an all-round,
crack-up education to put him where it&#8217;s
worth while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You still have time to work up. You are
not much over thirty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-seven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-seven! I should have thought&#8211; What
a hard life you must have had!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard work? Well, I suppose Panama did do
for me some. But it wasn&#8217;t so much that. Few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
fellows could hit up the pace I&#8217;ve set and come
out at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what you might expect of a fellow in
my fix&#8211;all kinds of gamble and drink and&#8211;the
rest of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Leslie looked away, visibly distressed.
She had not been reared after the French method.
Young as she was, she had fluttered at will about
the borders of the garden of vice, knowing well
that the gaudy blossoms were lures to entice one
into the pitfall. Yet never before had she caught
so clear a glimpse of the slimy depths.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; growled Blake. &#8220;Throw me
down cold, just because I&#8217;m square enough to
tell you straight out. You make me tired! I&#8217;m
not one of the work-ox sort, that can chew the cud
all the year round, and cork the blood out of
their brains. I&#8217;ve got to cut loose from the
infernal grind once in a while, and barring a
chance now and then at opera, there&#8217;s never
been anything but a spree&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but that&#8217;s so dreadfully shocking, Mr.
Blake!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then like all the other little hypocrites,
you&#8217;ll go and marry one of those swell
dudes who&#8217;s made that sort of thing his business,
and everybody knows it, but it&#8217;s all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
politely understood to&#8217;ve been done sub rosa,
so it&#8217;s all right, because he knows how to part
his name in the middle and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, please stop, Mr. Blake! You don&#8217;t
know how cruel you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cruel? Suppose I told you about the millionaire
cur that&#8211; Oh, now, don&#8217;t go and cry!
Please don&#8217;t cry, Miss Jenny! I wouldn&#8217;t hurt
your feelings for the world! I didn&#8217;t mean anything
out of the way, really I didn&#8217;t! It&#8217;s only
that when I get to thinking of&#8211;of things, it sets
me half crazy. And now, can&#8217;t you see how it&#8217;s
going to be ten times worse for me after&#8211;with
you so altogether beyond me&#8211;&#8221; He stopped
short, flushed, and stammered lamely, &#8220;I&#8211;I
didn&#8217;t mean to say that!&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked down, no less embarrassed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please let us talk of something else,&#8221; she murmured.
&#8220;It has been such a pleasant morning,
until you&#8211;until we began this silly discussion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, all right! Only mop up the dewdrops,
and we&#8217;ll turn on the sun machine. I
really didn&#8217;t mean to rip out that way at all.
But, you see, the thing&#8217;s been rankling in me ever
since we came aboard ship at the Cape, and Winthrope
and Lady Bayrose had my seat changed so
I couldn&#8217;t see you&#8211; Not that I hold anything
against them now&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>&#8220;Mr. Blake, I suppose you know that this
African coast is particularly dangerous for women.
So far I have escaped the fever. But you yourself
said that the longer the attack is delayed,
the worse it will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake&#8217;s face darkened, and he turned to stare
inland along the ridge. She had flicked him on
the raw, and he thought that she had done so
intentionally.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think I haven&#8217;t tried&#8211;that I&#8217;ve been
shamming!&#8221; he burst out bitterly. &#8220;You&#8217;re
right. There&#8217;s the one chance&#8211; But I
couldn&#8217;t leave you till the barricade was finished,
and it&#8217;s been only a few days since&#8211; All the
same, I oughtn&#8217;t to&#8217;ve waited a day. I&#8217;ll start
it to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Start what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A catamaran. I can rig one up, in short
order, that, with a skin sail and an outrigger, will
do fairly well to coast along inside the reefs&#8211;barring
squalls. Worst thing is that it&#8217;s all a
guess whether the nearest settlement is up the
coast or down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you can think of going, and leaving me
all alone here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better than letting you risk two-to-one
chances on feeding the sharks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;d be risking it!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>Blake uttered a short harsh laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the difference?&#8221; He paused a
moment; then added, with grim humor, &#8220;Anyway,
they&#8217;ll have earned a meal by the time
they get me chewed up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You sha&#8217;n&#8217;t go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. We&#8217;ll see about it to-morrow.
There&#8217;s a grove of cocoanuts yonder.
Come on, and I&#8217;ll get some nuts. I can&#8217;t see any
water around here, and it would be dry eating,
with only the flask.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span><a id='link_24'></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>A LION LEADS THEM</span></h2>

<p>The palm grove stood under the lee of the
ridge, on a stretch of bare ground. Other
than seaward, the open space was hemmed
in by grass jungle, interspersed with clumps of
thorn-brush. On the north side a jutting corner
of the tall, yellow spear-grass curved out and
around, with the point of the hook some fifty
yards from the palms. Elsewhere the distance to
the jungle was nearly twice as far.</p>

<p>Blake dropped the bag and his weapons, flung
down his hat, and started up a palm shaft. The
down-pointing bristles of his skin trousers aided
his grip. Though the lofty crown of the palm
was swaying in the wind, he reached the top and
was down again before Miss Leslie had arranged
the contents of the lunch bag.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;re not extra hungry,&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>She made no response.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mad, eh? Well, toss me the little knife.
Mine has got too good a meat-edge to spoil on
these husks.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>&#8220;It was very kind of you to climb for the nuts,
and the wind blowing so hard up there,&#8221; she said,
as she handed over the penknife. &#8220;I am not
angry. It is only that I feel tired and depressed.
I hope I am not going to be&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; you&#8217;re not going to have the fever, or
any such thing! You&#8217;re played out, that&#8217;s all.
I&#8217;m a fool for bringing you so far. You&#8217;ll be all
right after you eat and rest. Here; drink this
cocoa milk.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drained the nut, and upon his insistence,
made a pretence at eating. He was deceived
until, with the satisfying of his first keen hunger,
he again became observant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, that won&#8217;t do!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Look
at your bowl. You haven&#8217;t nibbled enough to
keep a mouse alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, I am not hungry. But I am resting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try another nut. I&#8217;ll have one ready in two
shakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught his hat, which was dragging past in
a downward eddy of the wind, and weighted it
with a cocoanut. He wedged another nut between
his knees, and bent over it, tearing at the
husk. It took him only a few moments to strip
the fibre from the end and gouge open the germ
hole. He held out the nut, and glanced up to
meet her smile of acceptance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>She was staring past him, her eyes wide with
terror, and the color fast receding from her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in&#8211; Another snake?&#8221; he demanded,
twisting warily about to glare at the ground behind
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8211;over in the grass!&#8221; she whispered,
&#8220;It looked out at me with terrible, savage eyes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Snake?&#8211;that far off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8211;a monster&#8211;a huge, fierce beast!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beast?&#8221; echoed Blake, grasping his bow and
arrows. &#8220;Where is he? Maybe only one of
these African buffaloes. How&#8217;d he look?&#8211;horns?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I didn&#8217;t see any. It was all shaggy,
and yellow like the grass, and terrible eyes&#8211;<i>Oh!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s scream was met by a ferocious, snarling
roar, so deep and prolonged that the air quivered
and the very ground seemed to shake.</p>

<p>&#8220;God!&#8211;a lion!&#8221; cried Blake, the hair on his
bare head bristling like a startled animal&#8217;s.</p>

<p>He turned squarely about toward the ridge, his
bow half drawn. Had the lion shown himself
then, Blake would have shot on the instant. As
it was, the beast remained behind the screening
border of grass, where he could watch his intended
quarry without being seen in turn. The delay
gave Blake time for reflection. He spoke sharply,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>
as it were biting off his words: &#8220;Hit out. I&#8217;ll
stop the bluffer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t. Oh, I&#8217;m afraid!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the hidden beast gave voice to his
mighty rumbling challenge. Still he did not
appear, and Blake attempted a derisive jeer:
&#8220;Hey, there, louder! We&#8217;ve not run yet!
It&#8217;s all right, little woman. The skulking sneak
is trying to bluff us. &#8217;Fraid to come out if we
don&#8217;t stampede. He&#8217;ll make off when he finds
we don&#8217;t scare. Lions never tackle men in the
daytime. Just keep cool a while. He&#8217;ll&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8211;there to the right!&#8211;I saw him
again! He&#8217;s creeping around! See the grass
move!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s only the wind. It eddies down&#8211;God!
he is stalking around. Trying to take us
from behind&#8211;curse him! He may get me, but
I&#8217;ll get him too,&#8211;the dirty sneak!&#8221;</p>

<p>The blood had flowed back into Blake&#8217;s face,
and showed on each cheek in a little red patch.
His broad chest rose and fell slowly to deep
respirations; his eyes glowed like balls of white-hot
steel. He drew his bow a little tauter, and
wheeled slowly to keep the arrow pointed at the
slight wave in the grass which marked the stealthy
movements of the lion. Miss Leslie, more terrified
with every added moment of suspense, cringed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span>
around, that she might keep him between her and
the hidden beast.</p>

<p>Minute after minute dragged by. Only a man
of Blake&#8217;s obstinate, sullen temperament could
have withstood the strain and kept cool. Even
he found the impulse to leap up and run all but
irresistible. Miss Leslie crouched behind him,
no more able to run than a mouse with which a
cat has been playing.</p>

<p>Once they caught a glimpse of the sinuous,
tawny form gliding among the leafless stems of
a thorn clump. Blake took quick aim; but the
outlines of the beast were indistinct and the
range long. He hesitated, and the opportunity
was lost.</p>

<p>Yard by yard they watched the slight swaying
of the grass tops which betrayed the cautious
advance of the grim stalker. The beast did not
roar again. Having failed to flush his game, he
was seeking to catch them off their guard, or perhaps
was warily taking stock of the strange
creatures, whose like he had never seen.</p>

<p>Now and then there was a pause, and the grass
tops swayed only to the down-puffs of the heightening
gale. At such moments the two grew rigid,
watching and waiting in breathless suspense.
They could see, as distinctly as though there had
been no screening grass, the baleful eyes of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>
huge cat and the shaggy forebody as the beast
stood still and glared out at them.</p>

<p>Then the sinuous wave would start on again
around the grass border, and Blake would draw
in a deep breath and mutter a word of encouragement
to the girl: &#8220;Look, now&#8211;the dirty sneak!
Trying to give us the creeps, is he? I&#8217;ll creeps
him! &#8217;Fraid to show his pretty mug!&#8221;</p>

<p>Not until the beast had circled half around the
glade did his purpose flash upon Blake. With
the wariness of all savage hunters, the animal had
marked out the spur of jungle on the north side,
where he could creep closer to his quarry before
leaping from cover.</p>

<p>&#8220;The damned sneak!&#8221; growled Blake. &#8220;You
there, Jenny?&#8221;</p>

<p>She could not speak, but he heard her gasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brace up, little woman! Where&#8217;s your grit?
You&#8217;re out of this deal, anyway. He&#8217;ll choke
to death swallowing me&#8211; But say; couldn&#8217;t
you manage to shin up a palm, twenty feet or so,
and hang on for a couple of minutes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;can&#8217;t move&#8211;I am&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make a try! It&#8217;ll give me a run for my
money. I&#8217;ll take the next elevator after you.
That&#8217;ll bring the bluffer out on the hot-foot. I
slip a surprise between his ribs, and we view the
scenery while he&#8217;s passing in his checks. Come;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span>
make a spurt! He&#8217;s around the turn, and getting
nearer every step.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t&#8211;Tom,&#8211;there is no need that both
of us&#8211; You climb up&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned about as the meaning of her whisper
dawned upon him. Her eyes were shining with
the ecstasy of self-sacrifice. It was only the
glance of an instant; then he was again facing
the jungle.</p>

<p>&#8220;God! You think I&#8217;d do that!&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no reply. There was a pause. Blake&#8211;crouched on one knee, tense and alert&#8211;waited
until the sinister wave was advancing
into the point of the incurved jungle. Then he
spoke, in a low, even tone: &#8220;Feel if my glass is
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her hand reached around and pressed against
the fob pocket which he had sewn in the belt of
his skin trousers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right. Now slip my club up under my
elbow&#8211;big end. Lick on the nose&#8217;ll stop a
dog or a bull. It&#8217;s a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>She thrust the club under his right elbow, and
he gripped it against his side.</p>

<p>At that moment the lion bounded from cover,
with a roar like a clap of thunder. Blake sprang
erect. The beast checked himself in the act
of leaping, and crouched with his great paws
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306'></a>306</span>
outstretched, every hooked claw thrust out, ready
to tear and mangle. In two or three bounds he
could have leaped upon Blake and crushed him
with a single stroke of his paw. As he rose to
repeat his deafening roar, it seemed to Blake that
he stood higher than a horse&#8211;that his mouth
gaped wide as the end of a hogshead. And yet
the beast stood hesitating, restrained by brute
dread of the unknown. Never before had any
animal that he had hunted reared up to meet his
attack in this strange manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lie flat!&#8221; commanded Blake; &#8220;lie flat, and
don&#8217;t move! I&#8217;m going to call his bluff. Keep
still till the poison gets in its work. I&#8217;ll keep
him busy long as I can. When it&#8217;s over, hit out
for home along the beach. Keep inside the barricade,
and watch all you can from the cliffs.
Might light a fire up there nights. There&#8217;s sure
to be a steamer before long&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom!&#8221; she cried, struggling to her knees,&#8211;&#8220;Tom!&#8221;</p>

<p>But he did not pause or look around. He was
beginning to circle slowly to the left across the
open ground, in a spiral curve that would bring
him to the edge of the jungle within thirty yards
of the lion. There was red now showing in his
eyes. His hair was bristling, no longer with fear,
but with sheer brute fury; his lips were drawn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307'></a>307</span>
back from the clenched teeth; his nostrils distended
and quivering; his forehead wrinkled like
that of an angry mastiff. His look was more
ferocious than that of the snarling beast he faced.
All the primeval in him was roused. He was
become a man of the Cave Age. He went to
meet death, his mind and body aflame with
fierce lust to kill.</p>

<p>The lion stilled his roars, and crouched as if
to spring, snarling and grinning with rage and
uncertainty. His eyes, unaccustomed to the
glare of the mid-day sun, blinked incessantly,
though he followed the man&#8217;s every movement,
his snarls deepening into growls at the slightest
change of attitude.</p>

<p>In his blind animal rage, Blake had forgotten
that the purpose of his lateral advance was to
place as great a distance as possible between him
and the girl before the clash. Yet instinct kept
him moving along his spiral course, on the chance
that he might catch his foe off his guard.</p>

<p>Suddenly the lion half rose and stretched
forward, sniffing. There was an uneasy whining
note in his growls. Blake let the club slip from
beneath his arm, and drew his bow until the
arrow-head lay upon his thumb. His outstretched
arm was rigid as a bar of steel. So tense and
alert were all his nerves that he knew he could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308'></a>308</span>
drive home both arrows, and still have time to
swing his club before the beast was upon him.</p>

<p>A puff of wind struck against his back, and
swept on to the nostrils of the lion, laden with the
odor of man. The beast uttered a short, startled
roar, and whirling about, leaped away into the
jungle so quickly that Blake&#8217;s arrow flashed past
a full yard behind.</p>

<p>The second arrow was on the string before the
first had struck the ground. But the lion had
vanished in the grass. With a yell, Blake dashed
on across to the nearest point of the jungle. As
he ran, he drew the burning-glass from his fob,
and flipped it open, ready for use. If the lion
had turned behind the sheltering grass stems,
he was too cowardly to charge out again. Within
a minute the jungle border was a wall of roaring
flame.</p>

<p>The grass, long since dead, and bone-dry with
the days of tropical sunshine since the cyclone,
flared up before the wind like gunpowder. Even
against the wind the fire ate its way along the
ground with fearful rapidity, trailing behind it an
upwhirling vortex of smoke and flame. No living
creature could have burst through that belt of
fire.</p>

<p>A wave of fierce heat sent Blake staggering
back, scorched and blistered. There was no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309'></a>309</span>
exultance in his bearing. For the moment all
thought of the lion was swallowed up in awe of
his own work. He stared at the hell of leaping,
roaring flames from beneath his upraised arm.
To the north sparks and lighted wisps of grass
driven by the gale had already fired the jungle
half way to the farther ridge.</p>

<p>Step by step Blake drew back. His heel
struck against something soft. He looked down,
and saw Miss Leslie lying on the sand, white
and still. She had fainted, overcome by fear or
by the unendurable heat. The heat must have
stupefied him as well. He stared at her, dull-eyed,
wondering if she was dead. His brain
cleared. He sprang over to where the flask lay
beside the remnants of the lunch.</p>

<p>He was dashing the last drops of the tepid
water in her face, when she moaned, and her
eyelids began to flutter. He flung down the
flask, and fell to chafing her wrist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom!&#8221; she moaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Jenny, I&#8217;m here. It&#8217;s all right,&#8221;
he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I had a sunstroke? Is that why it
seems so&#8211; I can hardly breathe&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, I tell you. Only a little bonfire
I touched off. Guess you must have fainted,
but it&#8217;s all right now.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310'></a>310</span>&#8220;It was silly of me to faint. But when I saw
that dreadful thing leap&#8211;&#8221; She faltered, and
lay shuddering. Fearful that she was about to
swoon again, Blake slapped her hand between
his palms with stinging force.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re it!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;The joke&#8217;s on
you! Kitty jumped just the other way, and he
won&#8217;t come back in a hurry with that fire to
head him off. Jump up now, and we&#8217;ll do a jig
on the strength of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She attempted a smile, and a trace of color
showed in her cheeks. With an idea that action
would further her recovery, he drew her to a
sitting position, stepped quickly behind, and,
with his hands beneath her elbows, lifted her
upright. But she was still too weak and giddy
to stand alone. As he released his grip, she
swayed and would have fallen had he not caught
her arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady!&#8221; he admonished. &#8220;Brace up; you&#8217;re
all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&#8211;I&#8217;m just a little dizzy,&#8221; she murmured,
clinging to his shoulder. &#8220;It will pass in a minute.
It&#8217;s so silly, but I&#8217;m that way&#8211;Tom,
I&#8211;I think you are the bravest man&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes&#8211;but that&#8217;s not the point. Leave
go now, like a sensible girl. It&#8217;s about time to
hit the trail.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311'></a>311</span>He drew himself free, and without a glance
at her blushing face, began to gather up their
scattered outfit. His hat lay where he had
weighted it down with the cocoanut. He tossed
the nut into the skin bag, and jammed the hat on
his head, pulling the brim far down over his eyes.
When he had fetched his club, he walked back
past the girl, with his eyes averted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>The scarlet in the girl&#8217;s cheeks swept over her
whole face in a burning wave, which ebbed slowly
and left her colorless. Blake had started off without
a backward glance. She gazed about with a
bewildered look at the palms and the barren ridge
and the fiery tidal wave of flame. Her gaze came
back to Blake, and she followed him.</p>

<p>Within a short distance she found herself out
of the sheltering lee of the ridge. The first wind gust
almost overthrew her. She could never have
walked against such a gale; but with the wind
at her back she was buoyed up and borne along
as though on wings. Her sole effort was to keep
her foothold. Had it been their morning trip,
she could have cried out with joy and skipped
along before the gusts like a school-girl. Now
she walked as soberly as the wind would permit,
and took care not to lessen the distance between
herself and Blake.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312'></a>312</span>Mile by mile they hastened back across the
plain,&#8211;on their right the blue sea of water, with
its white-caps and spray; on their left the yellow
sea of fire, with its dun fog of smoke.</p>

<p>Once only had Blake looked back to see if the
girl was following. After that he swung along,
with down-bent head, his gaze upon the ground.
Even when he passed in under the grove and
around the pool to the foot of the cleft, he began
the ascent without waiting to assist her up the
break in the path. The girl came after, her lips
firm, her eyes bright and expectant. She drew
herself up the ledge as though she had been
bred to mountain climbing.</p>

<p>Inside the barricade Blake was waiting to close
the opening. She crept through, and rose to
catch him by the sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom, look at me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Once I was
most unjust to you in my thoughts. I wronged
you. Now I must tell you that I think you are
the bravest&#8211;the noblest man&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get away!&#8221; he exclaimed, and he shook off
her hand roughly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool! You don&#8217;t
know what you&#8217;re talking about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I do, Tom. I believe that you are&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a blackguard&#8211;do you hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No blackguard is brave. The way you faced
that terrible beast&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313'></a>313</span>&#8220;Yes, blackguard&#8211;to&#8217;ve gone and shown to
you that I&#8211;to&#8217;ve let you say a single word&#8211;Can&#8217;t
you see? Even if I&#8217;m not what you call a
gentleman, I thought I knew how any man ought
to treat a woman&#8211;but to go and let you know,
before we&#8217;d got back among people!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&#8211;but, Tom, why not, if we&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; he retorted harshly. &#8220;I&#8217;m going now
to pile up wood on the cliff for a beacon fire. In
the morning I&#8217;ll start making that catamaran&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you shall not&#8211; You shall not go off,
and leave me, and&#8211;and risk your life! I can&#8217;t
bear to think of it! Stay with me, Tom&#8211;dear!
Even if a ship never came&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned resolutely, so as not to see her
blushing face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come now, Miss Leslie,&#8221; he said in a dry,
even tone; &#8220;don&#8217;t make it so awfully hard.
Let&#8217;s be sensible, and shake hands on it, like
two real comrades&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>She struck frantically at his outstretched hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep away&#8211;I hate you!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>Before he could speak, she was running up the
cleft.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314'></a>314</span><a id='link_25'></a>CHAPTER XXV<br /><span class='h2fs'>IN DOUBLE SALVATION</span></h2>

<p>When, an hour or more after dawn the
next morning, the girl slowly drew
open her door and came out of the
cave, Blake was nowhere in sight. She sighed,
vastly relieved, and hastened across to bathe her
flushed face in the spring. Stopping every few
moments to listen for his step down the cleft, she
gathered up a hamper of food and fled to the
tree-ladder.</p>

<p>As she drew herself up on the cliff, she noticed
a thin column of smoke rising from the last
smouldering brands of a beacon fire that had been
built in the midst of the bird colony, on the extreme
outer edge of the headland. She did not,
however, observe that, while the smoke column
streamed up from the fire directly skyward, beyond
it there was a much larger volume of smoke,
which seemed to have eddied down the cliff face
and was now rolling up into view from out over
the sea. She gave no heed to this, for the sight
of the beacon had instantly alarmed her with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315'></a>315</span>
possibility that Blake was still on the headland,
and would imagine that she was seeking him.</p>

<p>She paused, her cheeks aflame. But the only
sign of Blake that she could see was the fire itself.
She reflected that he might very well have left
before dawn. As likely as not, he had descended
at the north end of the cleft, and had gone off to
the river to start his catamaran. At the thought
all the color ebbed from her cheeks and left her
white and trembling. Again she stood hesitating.
With a sigh she started on toward the signal staff.</p>

<p>She was close upon the border of the bird colony,
when Blake sat up from behind a ledge, and
she found herself staring into his blinking eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he mumbled drowsily. He sprang
up, wide awake, and flushing with the guilty consciousness
of what he had done. &#8220;Look at the
sun&#8211;way up! Didn&#8217;t mean to oversleep, Miss
Leslie. You see I was up pretty late, tending the
beacon. But of course that&#8217;s no excuse&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; she exclaimed. There were tears in
her eyes; yet she smiled as she spoke. &#8220;I know
what you mean by &#8216;pretty late.&#8217; You&#8217;ve been
up all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t. Not all night&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure! I quite understand, Mr. Thomas
Blake!... Now, sit down, and eat this luncheon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t. Haven&#8217;t time. I&#8217;ve got to get to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316'></a>316</span>
river and set to work. I&#8217;ll get some jerked beef
and eat it on the way. You see&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom!&#8221; she protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s for you,&#8221; he rejoined, and his lips closed
together resolutely.</p>

<p>He was stepping past her, when over the seaward
edge of the cliff there came a sound like the
yell of a raging sea-monster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Siren!&#8221; shouted Blake, whirling about.</p>

<p>The cloud of smoke beyond the cliff end was
now rolling up more to the left. He dashed away
towards the north edge of the cliff as though he
intended to leap off into space. The girl ran
after him as fast as she could over the loose
stones. Before she had covered half the distance
she saw him halt on the very brink of the cliff,
and begin to wave and shout like a madman. A
few steps farther on she caught sight of the
steamer. It was lying close in, only a little way
off the north point of the headland.</p>

<p>Even as she saw the vessel, its siren responded
to Blake&#8217;s wild gestures with a series of joyous
screams. There could be no mistake. He had
been seen. Already they were letting go anchor,
and there was a little crowd of men gathering
about one of the boats. Blake turned and started
on a run for the cliff. But Miss Leslie darted
before him, compelling him to halt.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317'></a>317</span>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; she cried, her eyes sparkling with
happy tears. &#8220;Tom, it&#8217;s come now. You
needn&#8217;t&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me by! I&#8217;m going to meet them. I
want to&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>But she put her hands upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom!&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;let it be now, before
any one&#8211;anything can possibly come between
us! Let it be a part of our life here&#8211;here,
where I&#8217;ve learned how brave and true a real
man can be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then have him prove himself a sneak!&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;No; I won&#8217;t, Jenny! I&#8217;ve got you
to think of. Wait till I&#8217;ve seen your father.
Ten to one, he&#8217;ll not hear of it&#8211;he&#8217;ll cut you
off without a cent. Not but what I&#8217;d be glad
myself; but you&#8217;re used to luxuries, girlie, and
I&#8217;m a poor man. I can&#8217;t give them to you&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>She laid a hand on his mouth, and smiled up
at him in tender mockery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, now, Mr. Blake; you&#8217;re not very
complimentary. After surviving my cooking all
these weeks, don&#8217;t you think I might do, at a
pinch, for a poor man&#8217;s wife!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Jenny!&#8221; he protested, trying to draw
back. &#8220;You oughtn&#8217;t to decide now. When
you get back among your friends, things may
look different. Think of your society friends!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318'></a>318</span>
Wait till you see me with other men&#8211;gentlemen!
I&#8217;m just a rough, uncultured, ordinary&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; she cried, and she again placed her
hand on his mouth. &#8220;You sha&#8217;n&#8217;t say such cruel
things about Tom&#8211;my Tom&#8211;the man I trust&#8211;that I&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her arms slipped about his neck, and her eyes
shone up into his with tender radiance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; he begged hoarsely. &#8220;&#8217;T ain&#8217;t fair!
I&#8211;I can&#8217;t stand it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man I love!&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>He crushed her to him in his great arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;My little girl!&#8211;dear little girl!&#8221; he repeated,
and he pressed his lips to her hair.</p>

<p>She snuggled her face closer against his shoulder,
and replied in a very small voice, &#8220;I&#8211;I
suppose you know that ship captains can
m-marry people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I haven&#8217;t even a job yet!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Suppose your father&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please listen!&#8221; she pleaded. There was a
sound like suppressed sobbing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he ventured, and he listened,
greatly perturbed. The muffled voice sounded
very meek and plaintive: &#8220;I&#8217;ll try to do my
part, Mr. Blake,&#8211;really I will! I&#8211;I hope we
can manage to struggle along&#8211;somehow. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319'></a>319</span>
know, I have a little of my own. It&#8217;s only three&#8211;three million; but&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; he demanded, and he held her out
at arm&#8217;s length, to stare at her in frowning bewilderment.
&#8220;If I&#8217;d known that, I&#8217;d&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d never have given me a chance to&#8211;to
propose to you, you dear old silly!&#8221; she cried,
her eyes dancing with tender mirth. &#8220;See
here!&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned from him, and back again, and held
up a withered, crumpled flower. He looked, and
saw that it was the amaryllis blossom.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8211;kept it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because&#8211;because, even then, down in the
bottom of my heart, I had begun to realize&#8211;to
know what you were like&#8211;and of course that
meant&#8211; Tom, tell me! Do you think I&#8217;m
utterly shameless? Do you blame me for being
the one to&#8211;to&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Blame you!&#8221; he cried. He paused to put a
finger under her chin and raise her down-bent
face. His eyes were very blue, but there was a
twinkle in their depths. &#8220;Oh, yes; it was dreadful,
wasn&#8217;t it? But I guess I&#8217;ve no complaint
to file just now.&#8221;</p>
